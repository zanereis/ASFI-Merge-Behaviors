I found that YGC did not perform well during the pressure measurement process. One of the reasons is that the lifetime of `TimeoutCheckTask` is relatively long (currently it will survive `timeout`).\r\n\r\nI try to shorten its life cycle to get better GC performance. It seems that my modification is successful.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-12T15:28:31Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T15:33:06Z","closed_at":"2019-05-13T15:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"269cfcbd8631477b141356d7a6bde7a06d52778a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/83ada89b00ebc00b92666f3cdef184a50cb632c3","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:cluster_utils","ref":"cluster_utils","sha":"83ada89b00ebc00b92666f3cdef184a50cb632c3","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-10T15:03:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T03:58:03Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T03:00:40Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T03:00:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"d77a009a859e62b6a9a68266059b61376549528e","assignee":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53e16b2eb5ca7234a1f5f76c7fdf6715c1f05fc2","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/nacos-metadata","ref":"feature/nacos-metadata","sha":"53e16b2eb5ca7234a1f5f76c7fdf6715c1f05fc2","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nissue #3137: step 2\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-10T03:13:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T06:40:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-10T06:19:53Z","merged_at":"2019-05-10T06:19:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"30c3c2f43190e736bf2564160509b36b3a21a8de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kun-song","id":4010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song","html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/97c62eb49d729db5871fadc6a296587fdb762bfc","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3137","ref":"issue3137","sha":"97c62eb49d729db5871fadc6a296587fdb762bfc","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement of netty native transport, inspired by grpc and netty. Please check this issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2737 .  We can find some transport enhancement from this upgrade, What's more, with default Epoll, we can have more transport advantages, such as TCP_USER_TIME,  choice between ET mode and LT mode, and so on.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nchange default transport to Epoll if available, otherwise using Nio.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

TypeBuilder\r\n2. add GooglePbTypeBuilder in dubbo-serialization-protobuf-json to build Protobuf entity class\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere's a refactoring work related to async on branch 3.x, it solves most of the problems in milestone 2.7.2 https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/3287, I think we can simply merge it to master. This can also help us to keep the core concepts in codebase in different branches the same.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-08T02:15:38Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T09:40:56Z","closed_at":"2019-05-08T02:28:23Z","merged_at":"2019-05-08T02:28:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"fbc0320e10246491be630041d1f6fd63eef4bccd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/55f0f2eb76e63955587ebb219a72f873e18b6f32","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3573","ref":"issue3573","sha":"55f0f2eb76e63955587ebb219a72f873e18b6f32","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"392fcbfd1a51418c92dce096b2d466c5890b9a17","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-07T09:40:31Z","updated_at":"2019-05-11T07:12:45Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T14:23:04Z","merged_at":"2019-05-09T14:23:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"f95e29a0e049046b066eec7e84643315dce5c0fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7a931ef66369178ece2604599fbeeaeaebc415fb","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/nacos-config","ref":"feature/nacos-config","sha":"7a931ef66369178ece2604599fbeeaeaebc415fb","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-06T03:38:31Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:51:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T06:30:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6db4bb74118cfd4a3b1b7908cdb6dd1de23a80f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b014bfb61d336087e9ff442ef1a7c3968d2579d5","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:serializationConstant","ref":"serializationConstant","sha":"b014bfb61d336087e9ff442ef1a7c3968d2579d5","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-05T08:28:00Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T07:08:19Z","closed_at":"2019-05-06T06:21:25Z","merged_at":"2019-05-06T06:21:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"ceb930e00f9458941ce1c658b323659aee94dbdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7aa6a70e07bbc3b81d629114a9b18dff568fb547","head":{"label":"Leishunyu:merge-thrift","ref":"merge-thrift","sha":"7aa6a70e07bbc3b81d629114a9b18dff568fb547","user":{"login":"Leishunyu","id":29188508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTg4NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29188508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu","html_url":"https://github.com/Leishunyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"77df9d7bd23f6fdeb41f8e4f81ce13a95abe5ed7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-03T06:08:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T09:54:00Z","closed_at":"2019-05-05T06:01:35Z","merged_at":"2019-05-05T06:01:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"70edcf80e95f73390ece1527e982e1e9fa04037b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3d25348e9542ebe23f818fdee5a7c63bfed5d41d","head":{"label":"slievrly:master","ref":"master","sha":"3d25348e9542ebe23f818fdee5a7c63bfed5d41d","user":{"login":"slievrly","id":8758457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8758457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly","html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166805208,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjY4MDUyMDg=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"slievrly/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slievrly","id":8758457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8758457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly","html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix a code problem\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-02T13:55:48Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T09:43:18Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T00:05:10Z","merged_at":"2019-05-07T00:05:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"392fcbfd1a51418c92dce096b2d466c5890b9a17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/15b78b9626cf1eb0fae1389440e1ce567761d2d7","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:router-chain-add-router","ref":"router-chain-add-router","sha":"15b78b9626cf1eb0fae1389440e1ce567761d2d7","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

file, it should contains nacos registry\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-02T06:14:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T06:09:16Z","closed_at":"2019-05-05T06:09:16Z","merged_at":"2019-05-05T06:09:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ce7ed3535b42b62b278ce132e8a5cc81065f7bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4108040c67c2f81f863c368910ca775fbaa6e0ca","head":{"label":"htynkn:fix-nacos-dependency-issue","ref":"fix-nacos-dependency-issue","sha":"4108040c67c2f81f863c368910ca775fbaa6e0ca","user":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"70edcf80e95f73390ece1527e982e1e9fa04037b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-29T06:29:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T02:01:37Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T02:01:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ad72a14bbc544f689ed6de0c332acf85d10886","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/49add8eae1f01d37b44d2aa892189b4d4cfc5fad","head":{"label":"htynkn:fix-travis-issue","ref":"fix-travis-issue","sha":"49add8eae1f01d37b44d2aa892189b4d4cfc5fad","user":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"efa83324ddd86080422eeb91b907b121dd11a347","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-27T06:54:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T15:35:47Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T15:35:46Z","merged_at":"2019-04-29T15:35:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"d54633edf0c396f8a18b17d6ba6970de436c6964","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e7d783090d0394c879b1cc5cb71ad7f1347b8df6","head":{"label":"liugddx:master","ref":"master","sha":"e7d783090d0394c879b1cc5cb71ad7f1347b8df6","user":{"login":"liugddx","id":48236177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjM2MTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48236177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx","html_url":"https://github.com/liugddx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liugddx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"efa83324ddd86080422eeb91b907b121dd11a347","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change to address issue #3802\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-23T11:22:08Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T10:32:42Z","closed_at":"2019-04-24T07:08:04Z","merged_at":"2019-04-24T07:08:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b11b7ac89c0d897220bc9b42b3e5e9c3eb708f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d34d88bf534b4dff1f1e13ee07a716c130a95f98","head":{"label":"felixz7:master","ref":"master","sha":"d34d88bf534b4dff1f1e13ee07a716c130a95f98","user":{"login":"felixz7","id":16345433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ1NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16345433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7","html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63161796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzE2MTc5Ng==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"felixz7/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"felixz7","id":16345433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ1NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16345433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7","html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7/dubbo","description":"Apache

a global executor to avoid task timeouts in the bucket to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n**Why we need a executor?**\r\n\r\nCurrently the tasks in all buckets will be executed synchronously at expiration.\r\nThis can cause a problem:\r\nWhen the task execution time in our `n` bucket is long,\r\nit may cause the task delay execution in `n + 1` bucket (although we do not recommend adding time-consuming tasks to HashedWheelTimer).\r\n\r\nSo we use an asynchronous executor to handle the task, which will avoid the delay of the task in the `n + 1` bucket to some extent.\r\n\r\n**Why we config this executor like this?**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a global executor, we don't want to create threads repeatedly.\r\nSecond, because it is a global executor, it is difficult to grasp the value of `keepAliveTime`.\r\nThird, we don't want the size of the queue to have a certain limit.\r\n\r\nWhen the submit task has a `RejectedExecutionException`, we will execute the task in synchronous

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-22T14:40:04Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T03:23:46Z","closed_at":"2019-04-24T03:23:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a95358d7393ce5565e59318815ea3106c6336542","head":{"label":"apache:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"a95358d7393ce5565e59318815ea3106c6336542","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-22T07:52:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T06:48:49Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T09:06:44Z","merged_at":"2019-04-29T09:06:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"86b1a9862c97f8857eb73022481082fd429df023","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f1d4e07672e11f1600cd110291969958bff4daf1","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/consul-test","ref":"feature/consul-test","sha":"f1d4e07672e11f1600cd110291969958bff4daf1","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

package\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-22T07:43:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T14:54:47Z","closed_at":"2019-04-22T14:54:47Z","merged_at":"2019-04-22T14:54:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"875a665104b9ad5f7daf73bfca899cd81271dd12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/82707d0977d3d44de565b24a40dfecf485a396ad","head":{"label":"maoyiz:issue-3903","ref":"issue-3903","sha":"82707d0977d3d44de565b24a40dfecf485a396ad","user":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138553275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg1NTMyNzU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Socks5ProxyHandler and add it to the first location of the ChannelPipeline\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-19T12:00:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T06:06:42Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T06:06:42Z","merged_at":"2021-03-15T06:06:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"89e5fe0f2770c69c714fbb5bb863f81e4f7224f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/35/labels","id":5730092,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTczMDA5Mg==","number":35,"title":"2.6.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-04T07:17:55Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T15:33:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-06-08T15:33:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9d9ce6249f35faa8ad88d2377c9a737466bcde64","head":{"label":"nihongye:2.6.x_featureSocks5Support","ref":"2.6.x_featureSocks5Support","sha":"9d9ce6249f35faa8ad88d2377c9a737466bcde64","user":{"login":"nihongye","id":3047058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye","html_url":"https://github.com/nihongye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174338492,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMzg0OTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"nihongye/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nihongye","id":3047058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye","html_url":"https://github.com/nihongye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nihongye/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRename some variables to avoid possible confusion between Result and AppResponse.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-18T12:01:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T03:47:20Z","closed_at":"2019-04-19T03:47:20Z","merged_at":"2019-04-19T03:47:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"13c157176a46d239db00303b3bb657dc686d03b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/394753e0d6a4899893e0df01f86044018843530d","head":{"label":"chickenlj:async-variable-rename","ref":"async-variable-rename","sha":"394753e0d6a4899893e0df01f86044018843530d","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-17T09:21:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T10:41:41Z","closed_at":"2019-04-18T02:51:43Z","merged_at":"2019-04-18T02:51:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a5f9054fa60d7cdb13034290dcbffddecff669d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5f869f5e5bcb692ea6e68db29dd6b5dca6fff74c","head":{"label":"chickenlj:ignore-flatten-related-files","ref":"ignore-flatten-related-files","sha":"5f869f5e5bcb692ea6e68db29dd6b5dca6fff74c","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","sub

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes #3875, support using the following on consumer side:\r\n`<dubbo:parameter key=\"dubbo.tag\" value=\"groupA\"/>`\r\n\r\nRelated issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/3359\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-16T08:27:00Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T06:17:12Z","closed_at":"2019-04-26T02:54:27Z","merged_at":"2019-04-26T02:54:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2be44d672a70eb2efd22bebf49f5885c7866da8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/407ecb69dcc22c8e23d39270fdc67437001e8ae5","head":{"label":"chickenlj:bugfix-#3875-tagrouter","ref":"bugfix-#3875-tagrouter","sha":"407ecb69dcc22c8e23d39270fdc67437001e8ae5","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-12T03:15:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T07:31:39Z","closed_at":"2019-05-22T07:31:38Z","merged_at":"2019-05-22T07:31:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"df084addc804ef727ae9f1959b10f88ffd5a0ddc","assignee":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-11T09:42:41Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T06:56:04Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T06:56:04Z","merged_at":"2021-05-23T06:56:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebe06877cf5b62660b1251042fe50f84ae7dc543","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe same effort as #3851, only this one is for 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUse revision to avoid pom version conflicts between different branches.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-11T03:14:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T07:39:56Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:37:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5da273234d1318a3d059015c3a4321ef4d580885","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently some tests in RegistryProtocolTest do not use the RegistryProtocol.getRegistryProtocol() method to get the singleton RegistryProtocol instance. These tests directly create new instances of RegistryProtocol, which changes the singleton to point to the newly created instance. Doing so leads to tests in test class to fail when run in certain orders. For example, running the tests [testNotifyOverride_notmatch, testExportUrlNull, testNotifyOverride] in that exact order leads to testNotifyOverride to fail.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to have every test use the RegistryProtocol.getRegistryProtocol() method to get the same instance of RegistryProtocol.\r\n\r\n## Brief

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request tries a different approach for achieving the same goal as #3738 by having Result extends CompletionStage and Future directly.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the code in this pull request, I strongly suggest using the way in #3738. Here are some drawbacks I found doing this PR:\r\n1.  CompletionStage is not convenient enough when programming, most of the time you will need CompletableFuture, but because Result itself is an Interface and most of the method uses Result instead of concrete Result class so you will only be able to interact with CompletionStage.\r\n2. We only need very few callback methods provided by CompletionStage\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-10T06:53:37Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:54:39Z","closed_at":"2019-04-12T03:27:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0df15aad6683431402ad387598a7125521c0aee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64bf999b7125ceed4c2709dded1b460bfb7cde1a","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:parseError","ref":"parseError","sha":"64bf999b7125ceed4c2709dded1b460bfb7cde1a","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix typo\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-09T15:09:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T15:38:10Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T15:31:44Z","merged_at":"2019-04-09T15:31:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d2be07a711a4f96b6e45e464886b276b3c49556","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/20a74933ae6cbb9a7d1e45aa7bdfa2d16ba51587","head":{"label":"rupertw:fix-typo","ref":"fix-typo","sha":"20a74933ae6cbb9a7d1e45aa7bdfa2d16ba51587","user":{"login":"rupertw","id":14285696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14285696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw","html_url":"https://github.com/rupertw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":172739164,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI3MzkxNjQ=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"rupertw/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rupertw","id":14285696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14285696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw","html_url":"https://github.com/rupertw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rupertw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rupertw/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, Generic Reference cannot support Google Protobuf. With bride usage of Google PB, we are going to support it via Generic Reference. See issue #3829\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1.  add ProtobufUtil.class  to serialize /deserialize Google Protobuf Object\r\n2.  modify GenericFilter.class\r\n\r\n## feedback wanted\r\nTo support Google PB Testing, GenericFilter is part of my change, also Service Metadata have to support that. If the solution is ok, i will continue on the Service Metadata part.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a GITHUB_issue field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x]   Format the pull request title like [Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x]   Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ]   Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in test module.\r\n- [x]   Run mvn clean install -DskipTests=false & mvn clean test-compile

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn
