new security page of ours looked a bit messy - mixing the security model, information about security patches and index of \"all other\" security topics.\r\n\r\nThis change cleans it up quite a bit:\r\n\r\n* \"Airflow Security Model\" and \"Releasing security patches\" are separated out - each to a separate page focusing only on model/release respectively\r\n\r\n* The index now does not contain everything mixed together - both in navigation and main page index\r\n\r\n* The model and releasing are also explicitly called out in the intro paragraphs for the securtiy index, underlying their importance - explaining to the reader that they should look at them first to understand the important topics mentioned in them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

ask our contributors to test pre-release candidates for Airflow and providers, but not everyone knows that Breeze allows to easily mix&match versions of airflow and providers that can be installed when running `breeze shell` or `breeze start-airflow` - which helps to test release candidates manually very, very quickly.\r\n\r\nThis change adds more detailed explanation and examples showing how

there are only helm tests changes in the incoming PR, the selective checks would miss CI image building, because none of those would trigger CI image build. Image build is triggered when one of the other test types was selected for running. However the Helm unit tests also use Breeze CI image as a stable runtime environment, so they actually need CI image to be built.\r\n\r\nThis change also triggers the CI image build when helm tests are scheduled to be run.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

far we only applied PyPi suffix for cross-provider dependencies - i.e. when one airflow package depended on another one released at the same time we added \"dev0\" suffix to their cross-dependencies, when building them on CI so that they can be installed together without conflicts (this is because of decisions made with PEP-440 where version suffixes are in different namespaces than the final versions, so it is impossible to specify \"final\" dependency as minimal and have the \".dev0\" satisfy it only for that single package.\r\n\r\nWith openlineage provider, we need to release it before Airflow 2.7.0 gets released, and openlineage provider depends on Airflow 2.7.0 so we need to also handle the situation, where OpenLineage has >= 2.7.0 for Airflow, but the dependency that is used to resolve dependencies in CI uses 2.7.0dev0. This is done by dynamically manipulating the dependencies in setup.py based on VERSION_SUFFIX_FOR_PYPI variable.\r\n\r\nThis variable in CI is set to \"dev0\" thus all packages built have \"dev0\" added as version, with this change if any package has\r\n>= <CURRENT_AIRFLOW_VERSION> specified, it will also be extended\r\nwith the same \"dev0\" suffix.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

far we only applied PyPi suffix for cross-provider dependencies - i.e. when one airflow package depended on another one released at the same time we added \"dev0\" suffix to their cross-dependencies, when building them on CI so that they can be installed together without conflicts (this is because of decisions made with PEP-440 where version suffixes are in different namespaces than the final versions, so it is impossible to specify \"final\" dependency as minimal and have the \".dev0\" satisfy it only for that single package.\r\n\r\nWith openlineage provider, we need to release it before Airflow 2.7.0 gets released, and openlineage provider depends on Airflow 2.7.0 so we need to also handle the situation, where OpenLineage has >= 2.7.0 for Airflow, but the dependency that is used to resolve dependencies in CI uses 2.7.0dev0. This is done by dynamically manipulating the dependencies in setup.py based on VERSION_SUFFIX_FOR_PYPI variable.\r\n\r\nThis variable in CI is set to \"dev0\" thus all packages built have \"dev0\" added as version, with this change if any package has\r\n>= <CURRENT_AIRFLOW_VERSION> specified, it will also be extended\r\nwith the same \"dev0\" suffix.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

wrong usage of nullable prop next to a ref. TLDR $ref shouldn’t have sibling. (unless OpenAPI 3.1 that allows description and summary only I believe).\r\nThis induce wrong api documentation and most importantly bugs in our python clients such as:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python/commit/ddd6fc0545a8066f474c765e1644a5202eebd256 That needs to be manually cherry picked on each new release.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python/pull/89 another occurence that we forgot to also manually patch post client generation.-\r\n\r\n\r\nThis allows to generate the expected api doc and the correct client.\r\nI Tried that locally by regenerating the client and making the problematic call, such as:\r\n```\r\n# The one that cancelled 2.6.2rc1 client.\r\ndag_api_instance.get_tasks(DAG_ID)\r\n```\r\nIt is working with this spec.\r\n\r\nAfter this we can:\r\n- Update the client release process to remove the cherry picking part. (manual fix)\r\n- Close https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python/pull/89\r\n- Add a pre-commit hook to prevent siblings on $ref elements. (check why the current spec validator wrongfully allows it)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T16:29:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T18:54:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T17:53:06Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T17:53:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"3141d4bff5fb80267b3f38955838eac89c9098fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's REST/HTTP API"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

from Airflow's Ruff configuration with a single [`namespace-packages`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#namespace-packages) entry.\r\n\r\nPreviously, all subdirectories of `airflow/providers` were enumerated in the `pyproject.toml`, but it looks like a few were added to the codebase over time but _not_ to the list in `pyproject.toml`, leading to some import-categorization drift (as visible in the below changes).\r\n\r\nRuff allows for namespace packages to be enumerated directly, which will ensure that future packages are handled consistently without any need to update the

I have used a regex to check its validity during creation and have allowed any alphanumeric characters plus some special characters albeit the ones that could potentially be used to introduce scripts.\r\n\r\nFurther, I have also set the limit of characters for a valid connection to be up to 200, which I think is also a reasonable number but happy to adjust based on feedback.\r\n\r\ncloses:

iamge of xcom_sidecar is not cunfigurable (code: [xcom_sidecar.py#36](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/utils/xcom_sidecar.py#L36)). In our situation we can not access the \"alpine\" image from the docker image registry. Then the pod will not be started because the pulling of image failed.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be very nice that the image of xcom_sidecar is configurable so that we can pass an image hosted by our registry.\r\n\r\nI see there was a merged PR about this feature https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/26766.

working on PR #32646, I observed that when tasks are marked \r\nfailed externally like from the scheduler e.g. in the case when scheduler \r\nmarks the task as failed as it timed out being stuck in the queue, we set \r\nthe state of the task as failed but do not set the `try_number` for the \r\nattempt. As a result, subsequent functionalities like downloading the logs, \r\nseeing legacy logs don't work as the corresponding `try_number` is not \r\nfetched and hence logs are not available for `try_number=0` which is being \r\nset for the task instance instead of the corresponding `try_number` based \r\non the attempt. The PR fixes this issue in handling external failures for \r\nthe task by setting the corresponding `try_number`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

mentioned in #27837, we should do something similar to DatabricksRunOperator instead of running the original executing logic in DatabricksRunNowDeferrableOperator This is due to a bug that causes issues with empty job IDs. The DatabricksRunNowOperator operates smoothly and supports deferrable mode, so this PR removes the malfunctioning execute method.\r\n\r\ncloses: #27837\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
