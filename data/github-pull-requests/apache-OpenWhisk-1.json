Errors creating the topic were inadvertently swallowed before this change due to using Try.map instead of Try.flatMap. We observed this when the Scheduler did not abort after failing to create it's scheduler topic.\r\n2. Using the topic partitions configuration does not work in it's current state. This is because the number of partitions for a new topic is provided as a separate parameter rather than part of the topic configuration.

I believe that use 'Falsy' because there's no need to check the length of doc.binding when it is not object type. And also, it's better to check Falsy or boolean before than the length of object.  \r\n```javascript\r\n// as-is\r\nvar isPublicPackage = functions(doc) {\r\n    return Object.keys(doc.binding).length == 0 && doc.publish;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// to-be\r\nvar isPublicPackage = functions(doc) {\r\n    return doc.binding && doc.publish && Object.keys(doc.binding).length == 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI confirmed that CouchDB 2.3.1 and 3.3.3 don't  print it out during re-building the index.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#5507 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

python requests 2.31.0.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- The previously installed requests==2.10.0 did not met the docker==4.0.2 requirements. Because of this pip always installed the latest version of requests when installing docker==4.0.2 (see ansible/roles/prereq/tasks/deploy.yml). This worked fine until requests==2.32.2 was latest version available and installed. This version contained changes which made docker==4.0.2 package to fail with for example: \"Error connecting: Error while fetching server API version: Not supported URL scheme http+docker\". This caused the deployment step to fail the build.\r\n\r\n- Installing requests==2.31.0 now avoids that the install of docker==4.0.2 updates to the latest requests and makes the builds successful again\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWith FPC, the list of managed invoker ids is determined by what's in etcd. However the metric reporting and invokers api still assume that 0...n invokers exist up to the max available id in etcd and will auto fill in any missing ids as offline. This is fine for a range to fill in by the current min starting point, but it's not providing any value to assume things start at 0. A cluster could have a monotonically increasing range of ids and potentially if original nodes are lost they shouldn't be assumed to be filled back in at 0.\r\n\r\nFurther, the current implementation already will not include invokers that are offline at the high end of the pool since the api / metrics just assumes that max id stored in etcd is the max id of the cluster. **Example ten node cluster of 0-9**:\r\n\r\n- nodes 8 and 9 are down\r\n- the api will then only return 0-7 as existing since 7 is the max remaining id in etcd once the lease expires for those nodes.\r\n\r\nWith this change, this applies the same functionality to the low end to account for clusters that don't always re-populate 0-x. \r\n\r\n- nodes 0 and 1 are down\r\n- the api will now return 2-9 as existing since 2 is the min remaining id in etcd\r\n\r\n\r\n- if node 5 is down in the middle between the min and max, that still will be auto-populated to be down.\r\n\r\n**It's also important to note that this change only applies to FPC as the 0-n expectation of invoker ids is more important for the original load balancer algorithm with co-prime hashing.**\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an

[here](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/common/Config.scala#L156) and at the same time properties [change](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/common/Config.scala#L150) in the loop which can lead to skipping some keys after

Description\r\nAs [`ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS` is removed from the required properties](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5375), it is no longer transformed into the whisk config from the environment

Description\r\nThis is to fix a bug in that ETCD data for non-existent containers persist forever.\r\n\r\nThis bug happens when a shared action is invoked.\r\nWhen the queue manager receives an activation message, it finds a queue based on the `docId` only and this is wrong.\r\nAs a result, the activation message could be sent to the wrong queue as long as the `docId` is same.\r\nBut the `docId` is same for all shared actions.\r\n\r\nex) \r\n- original action: `/whisk.system/sharedPackage/hello`\r\n- bound action1: `/style95/myPackage/hello` (docId: `/whisk.system/sharedPackage/hello`)\r\n- bound action2: `/bdoyle/yourPackage/hello` (docId: `/whisk.system/sharedPackage/hello`) \r\n\r\nSo an activation for `/style95/myPackage/hello` could be sent to `/bdoyle/yourPackage/hello`.\r\nThen a memory queue will send the activation to a container for `/style95/myPackage/hello`.\r\nThe container is initialized with `/style95/myPackage/hello` and it registers the ETCD data for the running container.\r\nBut after executing the activation for `/bdoyle/yourPackage/hello`, it tries to remove the ETCD data for the running container using the key prefix with `/bdoyle/yourPackage/hello` because the key now resides in the container data(`WarmData`).\r\nAccordingly, the original ETCD data for the running container is not deleted forever.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the following logs that I found.\r\n(The shared action is `whisk.system/sharedPackage/hello` and I replaced the name of two namespace to `style95` and `bdoyle`  from the original logs just to hide proprietary information.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2023-08-04T16:31:49.392Z] [INFO] [#tid_5de45169ee33b5678a8067431ba09ca8] [QueueManager] Got activation message

build scans on ge.apache.org to benefit from deep build insights\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR publishes a build scan for every CI build on Jenkins and GitHub Actions and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.\r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache OpenWhisk project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache OpenWhisk project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Apache OpenWhisk build is configured to publish build scans to the publicly available [scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/). This pull request enhances that functionality by instead publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/). On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache OpenWhisk will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the Maven builds already connected to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), the [Spring project’s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis metric unfortunately does not work as a gauge. A gauge will report until there is a change in the value. I previously made a change so that the value would change back to 0 when a new activation is processed. However this does not account for 1. when the queue is stopped before setting the value back to 0 and 2. a queue is moved to a new host before the value is set back to 0 so the value for the action is still emitting 1 until a restart incorrectly reporting.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the

Description\r\nThis will add support to configure a certain topic class to have a specified number of partitions by including a `partitions` config in the configuration for that topic class. This currently does not include the consumer metric reporting for delay and lag since it assumes a single partition topic so it uses only partition 0 to emit that metric. But this change will unblock from attempting to use multiple partitions for your kafka topics by not having the producer use specify a key for the producer record such that the kafka messages are always hashed to the same consistent partition.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following

Description\r\nThe average ring buffer has an edge case where discarding the max and min outliers from the average calculation can result in the average being negative due to the max and min not ever being reset even when the max and min value is ultimately discarded from the ongoing buffer. So the way it's set up it keeps the absolute max and absolute min duration for this function that has ever occurred. I just got rid of the max and min outlier discarding for now because I don't think it's adding much value and to appropriately update the max and min would require a performance hit to the ring buffer. I've also added negative duration buffer protection to the scheduling decision maker so that if such a case were introduced again in the future, the scheduling decision maker can more gracefully handle it and still fallback to scheduling containers when there are stale activations rather than thinking the amount of containers to schedule is negative.\r\n\r\nHere is a raw example of how things can go wrong.\r\n\r\nThere is an edge case on the (sum - max - min) / (size - 2) calculation. The max never gets reset even if the element leaves the buffer. So say you have a random activation that takes 60s to run. The normal case is that all other activations take 50ms. If the buffer size is 10, then the sum should = 500 assuming the 60000 activation has left the buffer. however the max value will still be set to 60000.\r\n\r\n(500 - 60000 - 50) / (10 - 2) = -7443ms\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\nSince the metric is a gauge, it will continue reporting the value once an action starts not processing and will never recover from the metric's perspective even if the action has actually recovered.

## Description\r\n\r\nTo support future changes to the akka serialized messages that use kryo, we need to use kryo compatibility serializer i.e. to support the max instances pr.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change if trying to rolling upgrade an existing cluster creating new action queues between the scheduler and controller.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using the new scheduler architecture, this change is completely non-impacting. If you are using the new scheduler architecture, you can either do a blue / green deployment with a new cluster to upgrade or if you must do a rolling upgrade of an existing cluster; you can upgrade the controllers first such that only things that will return 503 during the deployment window are new actions that have not been running, live running queues in the scheduler would continue to be able to take activations.\r\n\r\nSince this is a one time breaking serialization change to the scheduler, I've also taken the opportunity to perform the major version akka-kryo upgrade to handle cve's for kryo 4. edit: I've removed this part of the pr as there seems to be other issues with upgrading akka-kryo\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there

Description\r\nThere is an edge case in the queue manager / memory queue where when the memory queue transitions from Idle to Removed, the action can get into an indefinite stuck state if it starts receiving activations again. This is because when transitioning from Idle to Removed, the `QueueRemoved` message to be sent from the MemoryQueue -> QueueManager is never sent which will remove the entry of the actor from the `QueuePool` trie map in the QueueManager. If the entry remains in `QueuePool`, the manager can still forward activations to the child memory queue fsm. The QueueManager receiving `QueueRemoved` is also responsible for sending `QueueRemovedCompleted` back to the MemoryQueue fsm which is what will actually make the memory queue stop itself. Since this series of events will never occur when transitioning from Idle to Removed, the Removed state thus becomes dependent on the `StateTimeout` to occur to actually stop the actor which _then_ will send the `QueueRemoved` message to the parent to have it removed from the `QueuePool`. It's important to note that the whole etcd series of events to remove the queue keys are successful and the queue manager acknowledges it with the `WatchEndpointRemoved`, but that does not remove the entry from `QueuePool`.\r\n\r\nHere is where things get catastrophic. Since the fsm actor entry will remain in the `QueuePool` trie map and the memory queue never sends the QueueRemoved message, the activations will continue sending to the memory queue IF a new activation comes in the five second window of the default configuration to time out the removed state. Akka fsm state timeouts work such that the timeout message is only sent IF no message is received otherwise the timer is reset every time a new message is received. The case in the removed state if receiving an activation will forward it back to the queue manager which will just send it back to the memory queue creating an indefinite cycle until the activation times out. Now if the action has a multi minute gap from having activations it will self heal because after the activation times out and no more come in, then it will self heal after five seconds. However, if that never happens the action will remain in a stuck state never executing activations until the service is restarted. This makes this bug particularly hard to track down because sometimes it could self heal and sometimes it remains stuck forever.\r\n\r\nThis StateTimeout behavior resetting the timer on each new message is already actually accounted for in the `Flushing` state so I've just added the same safe guard here to guarantee self recovery and that the queue will definitely shut down correctly after the stop grace time. However that's just a safeguard, I think there is still a remaining issue to solve that `QueueRemoved` needs to be sent to the `QueueManager` somewhere on transition from `Idle` to `Removed`, not only once the `Removed` state times out; otherwise transition from `Idle` -> `Removed` will always rely on the StateTimeout for the fsm to stop itself.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened

Description\r\nThe memory queue will now track the last time that an activation has been pulled by a grpc request to send to an invoker. If an activation is dropped from the queue from aging out and there hasn't been a single activation grabbed by an invoker for the entire duration that the activation sat in the queue, then this gauge will fire. This is needed as a fail safe to be made aware to any edge cases in the system where etcd data gets out of sync and containers are thought to exist by the scheduler that do not exist. Simply looking at activations timing out is not enough to determine an issue since the action may just be hitting throttling limits for number of containers.\r\n\r\nSo this should fire in only one case:\r\n1. There's a bug in the scheduler that needs a restart of either the invokers and schedulers to get the queue back into a healthy state.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue

Description\r\nThe dependency upgrade I merged in over the weekend has an issue with the logback minor upgrade. It seems the package is built past jdk8 and fails at runtime when trying to run with jdk8.

Description\r\nHave the scheduling decision maker make container creation decisions using a throughput calculation that considers how many concurrent requests a container can take. This should exhibit the same throughput guarantees as is, but without unnecessary potential fan out of containers when an action has concurrency greater than one since the scheduler didn't consider it up until this point. **There is no semantic change to behavior from this commit if action concurrency == 1.**\r\n\r\nExample: consider you have 100 incoming activations in the queue for an action with a concurrency of 10 with 1 existing container up currently processing 10 activations when the scheduling decision is made. The average duration is 10ms so the container throughput for this action due to the concurrency is really 100. So needed containers should already be met with just 1 container. However, currently the decision maker since it doesn't consider concurrency would create an additional 9 containers far exceeding the true needed number of containers.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

Description\r\nFirst step to getting rid of the zookeeper dependency on the invokers. Invokers currently can already be started without the zookeeper config if `--id` flag is set which is already the case in ansible. The only case that needs to be covered still before removing the dependency is adding support for kubernetes deployment. If started without config and need to connect to zookeeper still, the invoker will fail and shut down anyways from failing to connect to zookeeper in the instance id assigner on startup so this shouldn't be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\nScheduler queue metrics for individual actions generates too many metrics since the action version is included in the metric name currently as a part of the action name. This PR breaks that up so that if kamon tags is not used the action version is not included in the met. Also one fix specifically to the `queueActivation` metric where the metric name had the namespace twice because the passed in string was `$namespace/$action` and the full entity path string of `$action` already includes the namespace.\r\n\r\nI've kept it such that the kamon tag will still include the version on the action tag value for now unless that becomes a problem as well.\r\n\r\n##

Description\r\nThis is a critical bug that's gone unsolved for several years. Since attachments are considered secondary files to the main action document, if the attachment is lost for whatever reason (upload timeout, concurrent upload, bad database replication, etc.) the action document is therefore corrupted in a stuck state because the document factory is set up to do a get of the document first when performing a `putEntity` or `deleteEntity`. The `WhiskAction` type overrides the `get` operation to include getting the attachment as a part of the `get` operation. However once the root document is retrieved, the attachment is then tried to be read and returns a not found making the `get` return a `DocumentNotFoundException` to the `putEntity` or `deleteEntity`. You can therefore never delete or update an action (that is broken since the attachment was lost) once in this state through the openwhisk api and must go through an openwhisk admin to delete the document directly from the artifact db. \r\n\r\nWorse, for updating an action it incorrectly returns a 409 to the user when a conflict isn't what's actually happening in this case. The `get` of the `WhiskAction` correctly returns a `DocumentNotFoundException` when the attachment is not found, however the `putEntity` function then catches this and tries to put the document without a revision thinking it is a brand new document for the artifact db when the root document does in fact exist so the db returns a 409 when a put request is sent to it without a revision; which is what is then fed back to the user on any update action attempt.\r\n\r\nI have implemented a simple fix that finally resolves this issue for updating and deleting an action in this missing attachment state without impacting any other behavior of the system outside of the update and delete action api. The change is simple in that we recover in the `get` of the `WhiskAction` type if getting the attachment fails for not being found only if an ignore boolean is set. This ignore boolean is only set when `get` is called within `putEntity` and `getEntity`, and only has an effect on the `WhiskAction` type.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced and verified in my environment that this change resolves the issue. Pre change put action returns 409, delete action returns 404, and get action returns 404 if `code=true` otherwise 200. Post change put action succeeds, delete action succeeds, and get action keeps the same expected behavior of 404 if `code=true` otherwise 200.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [X] I opened an

Description\r\nI believe this optimizes scheduling decisions and reduces overprovisioning without sacrificing any performance. The reasoning here is if a queue has stale activations, you risk over-provisioning if you make the calculation based on all available messages,  not just stale ones. Here is an example:\r\n\r\nt0ms: 5 activation arrives and for whatever reason it takes 100ms before the activation is processed even if there are containers existing (random network latency or whatever the brief blip may be). Let's say container throughput is 10 (10ms duration) and there's already 10 containers.\r\nt50ms: 100 activations arrive and are available\r\nt100ms: 5 activation is stale and enters the decision case when there is a stale activation. However it uses all 105 activations available to make a scheduling decision. 105 / 10 will create 11 containers. But it's not yet certain that the available messages can't be processed before going stale. You've therefore doubled containers for the action to 21 unnecessarily when 11 would be satisfactory. What this pr does is use the 5 stale activations at decision time to determine how much additional capacity is needed instead of total available activations, in this case it would be ceil(5 / 10) = 1.

Description\r\nGet state of invoker container pool over http route.\r\n\r\nNew GET route `/pool` returns a high level overview of the current state of its container pool. Useful for numerous things, one is being able to know when a disabled invoker has cleared out so it can be gracefully clear out. But also useful just for seeing a live state of things. We can leave it an experimental api for now subject to change.\r\n\r\nHere is an example output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"busyPool\": {\r\n    \"containers\": [\r\n         {\r\n

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis is to delete ETCD data first when disabling an invoker.\r\nPreviously data was removed only after an activation client proxy is completely closed.\r\n\r\nBut when there are many containers running for a given action and we disable an invoker, it may cause a sudden container creation spike. Since some containers are suddenly removed, a scheduler would decide to provision similar numbers of containers at once.\r\nIf we delete the ETCD data first, then schedulers can initiate container provisioning while disabled containers are still processing the last activation for them.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [] Scheduler\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nI don't think this feature should be turned on by default. You should be required to configure to keep the compute around rather than it leave one container by default for an extra x minutes (I think the default system config for this is 10min) past the idle timeout. It also isn't very helpful to default to that by namespace because there can be multiple actions per namespace so it's not very helpful to by default leave one container hanging around using resources when the next request may not even be for that action within the namespace.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss here, but figured I'd just go ahead and open the pr to discuss\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n-

Description\r\nThis adds a periodic message to the container proxy that will make a request to the function cache to keep the function in the cache. The cache used to store downloaded functions has a keepalive for 5 minutes between accesses before it evicts. The default openwhisk container idleTimeout is 10 minutes. This means if you're using the default, you have a five minute gap between when a function is evicted and the container continues to run where once the container is unpaused it has to redownload the function before serving an activation. This doesn't really make any sense since behavior wise since the warm container already has the data it needs and the function check is mainly just for verifying it hasn't been updated. So this takes re-downloading the function cache off the critical path for an already warm container, but also since the cache is pinged on a 1 minute interval, so less than the cache eviction time; the function should never need to be re-downloaded so long as a container still exists for the function on the invoker.\r\n\r\nHeuristically, this makes a noticeable difference to the tp99 cases for functions. Especially functions that are >10mb in size and are infrequently accessed to hit this case.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nYou can read a more detailed series of events to hit this case in the corresponding issue, but here's the tldr:\r\n\r\n1. Container doesn't have activations so transitions to pause container.\r\n2. Container times out once paused and is ready to be deleted.\r\n3. In order to delete once paused, a check is required for the count of containers to determine whether it should delete.\r\n4. The etcd request fails and the failed future is piped to the fsm. The paused state doesn't handle this message type so it stashes it until a state transition and the container proxy will sit in this corrupted state until a new activation is received.\r\n5. New activation is received and the container is attempted to be unpaused and the fsm transitions back to Running while it waits for the unpause future to complete.\r\n6. When the fsm transitions, it unstashes the failed future message from 4. which is handled in the Running state and goes to destroy the container.\r\n7. The container is destroyed, but the unpause future from 5. succeeds which has a side effect to rewrite the container key to etcd and this key is now orphaned forever since the container was actually destroyed.\r\n8. The scheduler sees the container from the watch endpoint it's listening to and now the queue for the action is stuck thinking one container exists forever that actually doesn't exist. If activations are infrequent enough that only one container is needed by the scheduling decision maker, then this action can never be run unless the system is restarted.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this case in my test environment many times and this change now handles everything gracefully. And added a unit test to simulate this case to verify the container proxy is gracefully torn down after a failed request to etcd.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [X] I opened an issue to

Description\r\nInclude the container and creation ids in the log when queue attempts to stop. Will help with debugging when in memory queue data gets out of sync with etcd or if etcd data hasn't been properly updated. Helps with knowing if the id corresponds to the id in the invoker that failed to make a request to etcd or if that id recovered and another container was lost with regards to tracking in the memory queue\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
