standby replicas and default acceptable lag.\r\n\r\nThe attached stream is an extension to the known de-duplication example often use in Kafka.\r\nThe goal is to assign a unique identifier to each key in the input topic and pass the key and identifier to the output topic.\r\nIf a key have previously been observed then reuse the ID given last time.\r\n\r\nThe test case contains an input and transform step that are both deterministic and so should the output due to the exactly-once semantics.\r\nThe test demonstrates that a re-balancing event can break the exactly-once semantics and this results in ids being reused.\r\nSee [README](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12540/files#diff-3ca480ef093a1faa18912e1ebc679be492b341147b96d7a85bda59911228ef45) for more details\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reliably reproduced on an i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz × 12 with 32 GiB Memory when using caching and the default acceptable lag for standby replicas.\r\n\r\nWhen caching is disabled OR the acceptable lag is set to 0 then the test no longer breaks.\r\nThe underlying cause is unknown and so is unknown whether the above settings fix or hides the problem.\r\n\r\nA similar issue have been reported here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/69038181/kafka-streams-aggregation-data-loss-between-instance-restarts-and-rebalances\r\n\r\nFlow of the test case :\r\n1) Produce 3000 messages.\r\n2) Start a stream.\r\n3) Wait for the 3000 messages to be processed.\r\n4) Start a new stream and wait for it to start syncing\r\n5) Produce 60.000 messages\r\n6) Wait for 5 second.\r\n7) Start a new thread which should introduce a re-balancing event.\r\n8) Wait until the entire log is processed by the stream.\r\n9) Check the uniqueness of the assigned IDs.","created_at":"2022-08-19T08:55:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T09:45:44Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T08:26:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b7e7ec6daf8334dac9f5702f6905d0b3c205a3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4b4941b92741df4c5caed026d4deeaea52395058","head":{"label":"chorslev:bug/streams-state-store-eos","ref":"bug/streams-state-store-eos","sha":"4b4941b92741df4c5caed026d4deeaea52395058","user":{"login":"chorslev","id":51323327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIzMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51323327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev","html_url":"https://github.com/chorslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526204776,"node_id":"R_kgDOH10_aA","name":"kafka","full_name":"chorslev/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chorslev","id":51323327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIzMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51323327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev","html_url":"https://github.com/chorslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chorslev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chorslev/kafka","description":"Mirror

First, we were not shutting down the timer services in `RaftManager` which are used in the purgatory implementation. This meant that operations remaining in purgatory could be completed even after `RaftManager` was shutdown. Second, the shutdown order in `KafkaClusterTestKit` was problematic. The `RaftManager` instance depends on the `SocketServer` in `ControllerServer`, but it was the latter that was shutdown first. Instead, we should shutdown `RaftManager` first as we do in `KafkaRaftServer`. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

you have an idea what is going on here? Also note that due to Mockito not working with inline `thenReturn` mock statements (see https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/FAQ#can-i-thenreturn-an-inlined-mock-) I did some refactorings in `StoreChangelogReaderTest`, i.e. `mockTasks` and `mockTask` have been moved from inner local methods to the class. This was also done as an attempt to solve the aforementioned problems but it ended up having zero effect (also note in general apart from these problems it had zero effect on the tests).\r\n\r\nAlso note that `@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")` is necessary because unlike EasyMock, Mockito doesn't have any support for generics in the `mock` method (see https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1531)\r\n\r\nFinally with `ProcesserStateManagerTest` some verifications, stubbed calls have been removed for the same reasons behind https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12505#discussion_r947652273, i.e. `MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs` was complaining that there was extra erroneous stubs/verifications and I needed to remove them to make `StrictStubs` happy. This stubbing was also unnecessary in

In state updater, when handling task corrupted exception due to invalid restoring offset, first delete the affected partitions from the checkpoint before reporting it back to the stream thread.

It's cleaner to do so inside the restore thread, plus it enables us to optimize by only deleting those corrupted partitions, and not all.\r\n2. In the state manager, handle the drained exceptions as follows (this is the same as handling all exceptions from `handleAssignment`): 1) Task-migrated, throw all the way to stream-thread as `handleTaskMigrated`, 2) any fatal Streams exception, throw all the way to stream-thread to trigger exception handler, 3) Task-corrupted, throw to the stream-thread as `handleCorruption`.

are a few cases in `ControllerApis` where we may see an `ApiException` wrapped as a `CompletionException`. This can happen in `QuorumController.allocateProducerIds` where the returned future is the result of calling `thenApply` on the future passed to the controller. The danger when this happens is that the `CompletionException` gets passed to `Errors.forException`, which translates it to an `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR`. At a minimum, I found that the `AllocateProducerIds` and `UpdateFeatures` APIs were affected by this bug, but it is difficult to root out all cases. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, `DeleteTopics` is not affected by this bug as I originally suspected. This is because we have logic in `ApiError.fromThrowable` to check for both `CompletionException` and `ExecutionException` and to pull out the underlying cause. This patch duplicates this logic from `ApiError.fromThrowable` into `Errors.forException` to be sure that we handle all cases where exceptions are converted to error codes.\r\n\r\n### Committer

the server will return `INVALID_REQUEST` if a `DescribeQuorum` request is sent to a node that is not the current leader. In addition to being inconsistent with all of the other leader APIs in the raft layer, this error is treated as fatal by both the forwarding manager and the admin client. Instead, we should return `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` as we do with the other APIs. This error is retriable and we can rely on the admin client to retry it after seeing this error.\r\n\r\nNote that we could also check for this error in `ForwardingManager` and retry the request from that context, but the current forwarding logic is only setup to handle retries for requests sent to the controller, which is logically distinct from the raft leader. The `DescribeQuorum` is a bit of an oddball from an API perspective because it is a multi-partition request, but it is always forwarded to the controller since there is only one raft partition. So to handle this case specially, we would have to unwrap the envelope and check the error for the __cluster_metadata partition. It seemed simpler to rely on the admin client to retry.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

pre-production 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 KRaft releases lacked support for FeatureLevelRecord.  It is\r\nnot possible to determine the version of the metadata log we should use when reading a metadata log\r\nwritten by such a version. Fortunately, in these versions, the only metadata change was the\r\naddition of a tagged field for leader recovery. This PR completes KIP-778 by addressing the\r\nquestion of what we should do when upgrading from a cluster that is on one of these pre-production\r\nversions. Our solution is to assume that a metadata image with no FeatureLevelRecord for\r\nmetadata.version has a verison of IBP_3_0_IV1.\r\n\r\nNew software versions of KRaft will continue to support the pre-production metadata version of\r\nIBP_3_0_IV1. However, as a special case, we do not support downgrading from a later version back to\r\nIBP_3_0_IV1. The reason is because downgrade would normally be accomplished by writing a\r\nFeatureLevelRecord, and IBP_3_0_IV1 does not support such records.  We also don't support\r\nformatting new clusters with a metadata version of IBP_3_0_IV1. For new clusters, the minimum is\r\nIBP_3_3_IV0.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some issues related to initializing new clusters. If there are no records in the\r\nlog at all, then we now insert the bootstrap records in a single batch.  (Previously, we were not\r\nclearly distinguishing between the case where the metadata log was empty, and the case where there\r\nwas no metadata.version record.)\r\n\r\nRefactor BootstrapMetadata into an immutable class which contains a 3-tuple of metadata version,\r\nrecord list, and source. The source field is used to log where the bootstrap metadata was obtained\r\nfrom. This could be a bootstrap file, the static configuration, or just the software defaults.\r\nMove the logic for reading and writing bootstrap files into BootstrapDirectory.java.\r\n\r\nAdd LogReplayTracker, which tracks whether the log is empty.\r\n\r\nFix a bug in FeatureControlManager where it was possible to use a \"downgrade\" operation to\r\ntransition to a newer version.\r\n\r\nIntroduce BatchFileReader, which is a simple way of reading a file containing batches of snapshots\r\nthat does not require spawning a thread. Rename SnapshotFileWriter to BatchFileWriter to be\r\nconsistent, and to reflect the fact that bootstrap files aren't snapshots.","created_at":"2022-08-14T20:05:51Z","updated_at":"2024-08-10T03:21:43Z","closed_at":"2022-08-26T01:12:31Z","merged_at":"2022-08-26T01:12:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0f918b242e223d9329ae61be8bf12894ba23d77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/54ddae8fd0fe075bb487dc343b01ed39fcba14d4","head":{"label":"cmccabe:bootstrap-fixes","ref":"bootstrap-fixes","sha":"54ddae8fd0fe075bb487dc343b01ed39fcba14d4","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

the producer.send() method has different mechanisms of throwing exceptions when EOS is enabled and when it is not. Furthermore, the exceptions returned in callbacks are also different at times which could lead to confusion. This PR aims to close the confusion by following one of the methodologies of [KIP-691](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-691%3A+Enhance+Transactional+Producer+Exception+Handling#KIP691:EnhanceTransactionalProducerExceptionHandling-UnifyWrappedKafkaException). \r\n\r\nIt wraps all non-fatal exceptions in`KafkaException` and throws fatal exceptions directly. It does the same for all styles of producer.send() variations(EOS/non-EOS/callback/future.get()). Note that the definition of fatal/non-fatal exceptions were obtained from the KIP.\r\n\r\nTo get the PR working, needed to make test changes. There was one method where `AuthorizationException` was wrapped in `KafkaException`. I removed those checks which made the tests working. This is what exactly the PR was aiming for. I didn't add more tests right now. If reviewers feel so, can add for sure.","created_at":"2022-08-13T12:02:38Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T13:58:23Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T13:58:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42907e4873cb0a972af046a539f0f0db20da49e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/18d1ab03e2e8fcd288d33363b09f390cfa314564","head":{"label":"vamossagar12:KAFKA-14138","ref":"KAFKA-14138","sha":"18d1ab03e2e8fcd288d33363b09f390cfa314564","user":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222145451,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIxNDU0NTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"vamossagar12/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12/kafka","description":"Mirror

is possible for the leader to send an `AlterPartition` request to a zombie controller which includes either a partition or leader epoch which is larger than what is found in the controller context. Prior to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12032, the controller handled this in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. If the `LeaderAndIsr` state exactly matches the current state on the controller excluding the partition epoch, then the `AlterPartition` request is considered successful and no error is returned. The risk with this handling is that this may cause the leader to incorrectly assume that the state had been successfully updated. Since the controller's state is stale, there is no way to know what the latest ISR state is.\r\n2. Otherwise, the controller will attempt to update the state in zookeeper with the leader/partition epochs from the `AlterPartition` request. This operation would fail if the controller's epoch was not still current in Zookeeper and the result would be a `NOT_CONTROLLER` error.\r\n\r\nFollowing https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12032, the controller's validation is stricter. If the partition epoch is larger than expected, then the controller will return `INVALID_UPDATE_VERSION` without attempting the operation. Similarly, if the leader epoch is larger than expected, the controller will return `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH`. The problem with this new handling is that the leader treats the errors from the controller as authoritative. For example, if it sees the `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH` error, then it will not retry the request and will simply wait until the next leader epoch arrives. The ISR state gets suck in a pending state, which can lead to persistent URPs until the leader epoch gets bumped.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we want to fix the issues with this handling, but we don't want to restore the buggy idempotent check. The approach is straightforward. If the controller sees a partition/leader epoch which is larger than what it has in the controller context, then it assumes that has become a zombie and returns `NOT_CONTROLLER` to the leader. This will cause the leader to attempt to reset the controller from its local metadata cache and retry the `AlterPartition` request.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

@cmccabe \r\nIt looks like a way to fix `DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest` in 3.2 is to backport https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/9c3f605fc78f297ecf5accdcdec18471c19cf7d6. I think it makes sense to to also backport https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/78038bca6688ce01f7df238d53142f5de3455863, otherwise `testKeyStoreAlter()` is really flaky. \r\n\r\nBefore I push to 3.2, I want you to take a look and confirm if this makes sense. \r\n\r\n### **Please do not merge this PR, instead I'll rebase directly the commits as we don't want to squash them.**\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-11T15:33:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T10:41:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T14:03:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e20632f495129a2da1ec057cc8d036664580e9a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b924d9a30ca9cd9341d99a3ed7160422f6ed22a1","head":{"label":"mimaison:KAFKA-14149","ref":"KAFKA-14149","sha":"b924d9a30ca9cd9341d99a3ed7160422f6ed22a1","user":{"login":"mimaison","id":903615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzYxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/903615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison","html_url":"https://github.com/mimaison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53746208,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mzc0NjIwOA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"mimaison/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mimaison","id":903615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzYxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/903615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison","html_url":"https://github.com/mimaison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mimaison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mimaison/kafka","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14162\r\n- The HoistField SMT currently returns an immutable map for schemaless keys and values - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/22007fba7c7346c5416f4db4e104434fdab265ee/connect/transforms/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/HoistField.java#L62\r\n- This can cause failures in connectors if they attempt to modify the SourceRecord's key or value since Kafka Connect doesn't document that these keys/values are immutable. Furthermore, no other SMT does this.\r\n- An example of a connector that would fail when schemaless values are used with this SMT is Microsoft's Cosmos DB Sink Connector -

is possible currently for a leader to send an `AlterPartition` request to a stale controller which does not have the latest leader epoch discovered through a `LeaderAndIsr` request. In this case, the stale controller returns `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH`, which causes the partition leader to get stuck. This is a change in behavior following https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12032. Prior to that patch, the request would either be accepted (potentially incorrectly) if the `LeaderAndIsr` state matched that on the controller, or it would have returned `NOT_CONTROLLER` after the stale controller failed to apply the update to Zookeeper. \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the problem by ensuring that `AlterPartition` is sent to a controller with an epoch which is at least as large as that of the controller which sent the `LeaderAndIsr` request. The way this is achieved is by tracking the controller epoch in `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` and ensuring that it is only updated monotonically regardless of the source. If we find a controller epoch through `LeaderAndIsr` which is larger than what we have in the `MetadataCache`, then the controller node is reset and we wait until we have discovered the controller node with a higher epoch. This ensures that the `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH` error from the controller can be trusted. \r\n\r\nA more elegant solution to this problem would probably be to include the controller epoch in the `AlterPartition` request, but this would require a version bump. Alternatively, we considered letting the controller return `UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH` instead of `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH` when the epoch is larger than what it has in its context. This too likely would require a version bump. Finally, we considered reverting https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12032, which would restore the looser validation logic which allows the controller to accept `AlterPartition` requests with larger leader epochs. We rejected this option because we feel it can lead to correctness violations.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

PR adds in 3 metrics as described in KIP-859:\r\n kafka.server:type=broker-metadata-metrics,name=metadata-load-error-count\r\n kafka.server:type=broker-metadata-metrics,name=metadata-apply-error-count\r\n kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=MetadataErrorCount\r\n\r\nThese metrics are incremented by fault handlers when the appropriate fault happens. Broker-side\r\nload errors happen in BrokerMetadataListener. Broker-side apply errors happen in the\r\nBrokerMetadataPublisher. The metric on the controller is incremented when the standby controller\r\n(not active) encounters a metadata error.\r\n\r\nIn BrokerMetadataPublisher, try to limit the damage caused by an exception by introducing more\r\ncatch blocks. The only fatal failures here are those that happen during initialization, when we\r\ninitialize the manager objects (these would also be fatal in ZK mode).\r\n\r\nIn BrokerMetadataListener, try to improve the logging of faults, especially ones that happen when\r\nreplaying a snapshot. Try to limit the damage caused by an exception.\r\n\r\nReplace MetadataFaultHandler with LoggingFaultHandler, which is more flexible and takes a Runnable\r\nargument. Add LoggingFaultHandlerTest.\r\n\r\nMake QuorumControllerMetricsTest stricter. Fix a bug where we weren't cleaning up some metrics from\r\nthe yammer registry on close in QuorumControllerMetrics.\r\n\r\nCo-author: Niket Goel

What\r\nThis PR fixes an AlterPartition regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12032\r\n\r\nWhen an AlterPartition request succeeds, the partition epoch gets bumped. In Zk controller mode the sender also relies on the AlterPartition response to be informed of the new partition epoch.\r\nIf the sender times out the request before a response is sent, the sender will have a stale partition epoch compared to the ZK controller state and will be fenced on subsequent AlterPartition request attempts. The sender will not receive an updated partition epoch until it receives a LeaderAndIsr request for controller-initiated ISR changes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe existing AlterPartition idempotency test did not catch this regression because the test uses the current partitionEpoch for the AlterPartition request. We update the test to try the request with various partition epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

patch changes the AlterConfigs behavior in KRaft mode to match that of ZK.

broker side (e.g., reloading trust stores and key stores).\r\n\r\nThe DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTests which reload key stores and trust stores are enabled in this PR to validate the new

working on [KAFKA-13877](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13877), I feel it's an overkill to introduce the whole test class as an integration test, since all we need is to just test the assignor itself which could be a unit test. Running this suite with 9+ instances takes long time and is still vulnerable to all kinds of timing based flakiness. A better choice is to reduce it as a unit test, similar to HighAvailabilityStreamsPartitionAssignorTest that just test the behavior of the assignor itself, rather than creating many instances hence depend on various timing bombs to not explode.\r\n\r\nSince we mock everything, there's no flakiness anymore. Plus we greatly reduced the test runtime (on my local machine, the old integration takes about 35 secs to run the whole suite, while the new one take 20ms on average).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

I have also addressed the pending comments from @mimaison in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Notes to help the reviewer:\r\n- When we run the tests using @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class) Mockito performs a verify() for all stubs that are mentioned, hence, there is no need to explicitly verify the stubs (unless you want to verify the number of times etc.). Note that this does not work for static mocks.\r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n`./gradlew connect:runtime:unitTest --tests AbstractHerderTest` is

PR build on top of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11017. I have added the previous author's comment in this PR for attribution. I have also addressed the pending comments from @chia7712 in this PR.\r\n\r\nNotes to help the reviewer:\r\n1. Mockito has `mockStatic` method which is equivalent to PowerMock's method.\r\n2. When we run the tests using `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class)` Mockito performs a verify() for all stubs that are mentioned, hence, there is no need to explicitly verify the stubs (unless you want to verify the number of times etc.). Note that this does not work for static mocks.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nValidated that test is run successfully as part of `./gradlew streams:unitTest` \r\n\r\n## Code coverage\r\n###

Changes\r\n- **mockito: 4.4.0 -> 4.6.1** (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases)\r\nMost important updates:\r\n  - Regression? Strictness set in @MockitoSettings ignored after upgrade from 4.5.1 to 4.6.0 https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2656\r\n  - Fixes https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2648 : Add support for customising strictness via @mock annotation and MockSettings https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2650\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why is this change needed?\r\n### Update 1\r\nAccording to the [Mockito documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T)) :\r\n> Although it is possible to verify a stubbed invocation, usually it's just redundant. Let's say you've stubbed foo.bar(). If your code cares what foo.bar() returns then something else breaks(often before even verify() gets executed). If your code doesn't care what get(0) returns then it should not be stubbed. \r\n\r\nWhile working on the [Replace EasyMock and PowerMock with Mockito for StreamsMetricsImplTest ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12947) I noticed that described behavior wasn't applied when you create a new `mock` like this.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final Metrics metrics = mock(Metrics.class);\r\n        when(metrics.metric(metricName)).thenReturn(null);\r\n\r\n        ... invoke SUT\r\n\r\n        verify(metrics).metric(metricName); // this should be redundant (according to docs)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation I figured out that described behaviour wasn't implemented until`v4.6.1`.\r\n\r\nWith this change we are now able to mock objects like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   Foo explicitStrictMock = mock(Foo.class, withSettings().strictness(Strictness.STRICT_STUBS));\r\n```\r\n- link to docs: [MockSettings.html#strictness](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.6.1/org/mockito/quality/Strictness.html#STRICT_STUBS)\r\n\r\n### Update 2\r\nIt looks like I can accomplish the same thing by using the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class)\r\n` instead of the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)` so mockito dependency version update is not mandatory, but it would be nice to stay up-to-date and use the latest version (it's up to MR reviewer to decide if we are going to merge this now, or just close the MR and update mockito version later).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-29T18:07:19Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T17:08:57Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T17:08:57Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T17:08:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"eeee8e206bcf105e68813812666268f796f0a379","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/897925d61ec339c3ebaf39a2650d9d9633194df9","head":{"label":"dplavcic:MINOR-Upgrade_mockito_test_dependencies","ref":"MINOR-Upgrade_mockito_test_dependencies","sha":"897925d61ec339c3ebaf39a2650d9d9633194df9","user":{"login":"dplavcic","id":9079844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzk4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9079844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic","html_url":"https://github.com/dplavcic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dplavcic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"54af64c33a1796bcea8a9990aa61c804d9fc0df4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

Minor indentation fixes\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n`./gradlew streams:unitTest --tests RocksDBMetricsRecorderTest` is successful\r\n\r\n## Notes to help the reviewers\r\n1. Mockito uses `MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class` to assert that all stubs are verified.\r\n2. Mockito does not have the concept of \"register-activate\" represented by \"when - replay\" in EasyMock. Hence, you only need to use \"when\" and that is all. No \"replay\" is required.\r\n3. `PowerMock.reset` is replaced by `Mockito.reset`\r\n4. Mockito does not have to distinguish between \"niceMock\" and a normal \"mock\". All mocks are \"nicemocks\".\r\n5. Mockito can mock static methods using `mockStatic`\r\n6. When `verify(mockObj).functionName()` is called, it is equivalent to `verify(mockObj, times(1)).functionName()` i.e. it validates that the function in invoked on mocked object exactly once.\r\n\r\n##

In the ZK code path, we expect the sensitive config values to be encrypted in-place, and so the update logic was decrypting these values. In KRaft, we do not encrypt the values in ConfigRecords regardless of the type.\r\n\r\nThis PR defines a new passthrough password encoder which is used in KRaft mode only.\r\n\r\nMost of the test cases in DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest have been converted to also run in KRaft mode.","created_at":"2022-07-28T19:48:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T15:47:06Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T17:28:06Z","merged_at":"2022-08-03T17:28:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfd9e6eccdfdf3a735c866d83ddc3095dabb1274","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5dc024b8358b3391ab73c838e5fe559aa50ac330","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-14111-sensitive-dynamic-broker-configs-kraft","ref":"KAFKA-14111-sensitive-dynamic-broker-configs-kraft","sha":"5dc024b8358b3391ab73c838e5fe559aa50ac330","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

Background\r\nAt the beginning of the test, we create a producer (say P1) & consumer (say C1) (with enable_auto_commit=true, auto.commit.interval.ms = 5000 and groupId=\"group1\"). P1 and C1 continuously write and read messages throughout the test and at the end we assert that all messages were received and **no duplicates were received**.\r\n\r\nDuring the execution of the test, we create more producers and consumers as we dynamically change configuration and assert sanity of produce/consumer operation. When creating a new consumer (say C2), **we create it in the same consumer group as C1, i.e. groupId=\"group1\"**.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nWhen C2 is created, it triggers a rebalance within the consumer group \"group1\" which already has C1. Thus, consumption of C1 is disrupted. Since C1 uses `enable_auto_commit=true`, there is a possibility that it reads duplicate messages after rebalance. When it reads duplicate messages after rebalance, it causes the test to fail.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nDo not disturb the operation of C1 when introducing C2 by creating C2 with a separate group \"group2\". This fixes the flakiness of the test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-28T10:18:59Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T09:20:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T17:48:25Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T17:48:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"78038bca6688ce01f7df238d53142f5de3455863","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bce7fcf6aa1da825847d1b3721ebac383785619a","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:alter-keystore","ref":"alter-keystore","sha":"bce7fcf6aa1da825847d1b3721ebac383785619a","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13809 : The FileStream connectors don't propagate all connector configs to their tasks.\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9228 : client overrides, converter configs, SMT configs may not be propagated to tasks on connector config updates. This isn't an issue for most connectors because connector configs are propagated to the tasks in the connector implementations. This isn't the case for the FileStream connectors, however. \r\n- This PR updates the FileStream connectors to be in-line with how most other connectors generate task configs (which is a good thing because these connectors are intended to be example connector implementations), and also works around the bug from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9228\r\n- Minor: Also update the inaccurate source and sink connector Javadocs to align with the [source](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0c5f5a7f8b3628e991459ba9cff414c675676b8b/connect/file/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/file/FileStreamSourceTask.java#L39-L41) and [sink](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0c5f5a7f8b3628e991459ba9cff414c675676b8b/connect/file/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/file/FileStreamSinkTask.java#L36-L38) task Javadocs\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n- Manually tested the sink and source connectors and ensured

trying to commit a batch of records to the __cluster_metadata log, the active controller should try to apply them to its current in-memory state. If this application process fails, the active controller process should exit, allowing another node to take leadership. This will prevent most bad metadata records from ending up in the log and help to surface errors during testing.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the active controller attempts to renounce leadership, and the renunciation process itself fails, the process should exit. This will help avoid bugs where the active controller continues in an undefined state.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, standby controllers that experience metadata application errors should continue on, in order to avoid a scenario where a bad record brings down the whole controller cluster.  The intended effect of these changes is to make it harder to commit a bad record to the metadata log, but to continue to ride out the bad record as well as possible if such a record does get committed.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the FaultHandler interface to implement these concepts. In junit tests, we use a FaultHandler implementation which does not exit the process. This allows us to avoid terminating the gradle test runner, which would be very disruptive. It also allows us to ensure that the test surfaces these exceptions, which we previously were not doing (the mock fault handler stores the exception).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, this PR fixes a bug where RaftClient#resign was not being called from the renounce() function. This bug could have resulted in the raft layer not being informed of an active controller resigning.","created_at":"2022-07-28T00:11:03Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T15:33:59Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T05:49:45Z","merged_at":"2022-08-05T05:49:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"555744da7040f1ad91decc3cf2b813285af60aa2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/37cc0006afebc5817e7af5e76e4e8cab0c44ddb5","head":{"label":"cmccabe:faults-II","ref":"faults-II","sha":"37cc0006afebc5817e7af5e76e4e8cab0c44ddb5","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

This follow-up PR is intended to help harden our integration tests against the mistakes that caused KAFKA-14101 by:\r\n1. Renaming `EmbeddedKafkaCluster::consume` to `EmbeddedKafkaCluster::consumeAtLeast` in order to clarify behavior and help distinguish between it and `EmbeddedKafkaCluster::consumeAll`.\r\n2. Adding a note to the Javadocs for `EmbeddedKafkaCluster::consumeAtLeast` warning about out-of-order consumption and data missing from topic partitions.\r\n\r\nThough ready for review now, this PR should not be merged until https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12429 is
