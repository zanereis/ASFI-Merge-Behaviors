PR is to solve the feature issue #3715  , I defined the high level abstract index storage interfaces , also with  a default mmap implementation , and a related test case. for a simple explain:\r\n\r\nThe Directory class is a flat list of files which may be xx.smooth 、xx.meta 、xx.drd and some other Druid temp files or durable files.\r\nThe IndexInput class is an abstract interface to read the content of some index files.\r\nThe IndexOutput class is an abstract interface to write index data to some files of the Directory.\r\nFrom Druid indexing aspect, the indexing files are written once and read more, the interface definition also observe the contract. \r\n\r\nIf this PR was accepted, I will rewrite other related codes to replace the java nio ByteBuffer to IndexInput at the interface level.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-24T11:04:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T07:10:14Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T07:10:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89c483ed8443f480f11f38cc1b8b01f21a9419aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/4f1eef1ddabc71b4ada4688cbb03aba4e47b70d4","head":{"label":"weijietong:feature-storage","ref":"feature-storage","sha":"4f1eef1ddabc71b4ada4688cbb03aba4e47b70d4","user":{"login":"weijietong","id":728692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong","html_url":"https://github.com/weijietong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fd14997b1d06b62ccc98b5ba94af2b27da661b63","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":6358188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzU4MTg4","name":"druid","full_name":"apache/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid","description":"Apache

PR to support using fully qualified hdfs path for dataSegment operations.\r\n\r\nWe ran into a situation where we didn't set `druid.storage.storageDirectory` to a fully qualified path which resulted metadata without qulified name. Now we want to migrate our data into a different hadoop cluster, this requires druid to talk to two hadoop clusters(during migration). By not having fully qualified name its impossible for druid to figure out which segment is in which cluster. Having this check done will always set fully qualified name and protect others to run into similar situation.\r\n\r\nI also noticed, our batch ingested segments are fully qualified, our realtime ingested one are not and they use the same config`druid.storage.storageDirectory`. This PR makes things more

main part of druid-io/druid#3667\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\n1. Reduce locking. The prev. version of this subsystem has a lot of locks, concurrentHashMaps, etc. There were two deadlocks found in this subsystem in the last couple of months: #3459 and #3593\r\n2. Try to prevent memory leaks\r\n\r\n**Refactoring outline**\r\n1. Cache management is decoupled from scheduling and management of `Future`s, which update caches periodically. The latter is moved to `CacheScheduler` class from `NamespaceExtractionCacheManager`. `KafkaLookupExtractorFactory` now works with `NamespaceExtractionCacheManager` directly, because it doesn't need the \"scheduling\" functionality. `NamespaceLookupExtractorFactory` works with `CacheScheduler`.\r\n2. Previously lookup caches were identified by \"namespaceID\" strings, which were UUIDs, generated in runtime. Now caches (and futures) are identified by object identity. It eliminates the need for synchronization and even storing them in `NamespaceExtractionCacheManager` or `CacheScheduler`. So instead of (pseudocode):\r\n```java\r\n manager.schedule(namespaceID, namespace);\r\n Map cache = manager.getCacheMap(namespaceID);\r\n ...\r\n manager.delete(namespaceID);\r\n```\r\nthe new approach is:\r\n```java\r\nCacheHandler handler = manager.createCache();\r\nMap cache = handler.getCache();\r\n...\r\nhandler.close();\r\n```\r\nor, for `CacheScheduler`:\r\n```java\r\nCacheScheduler.Entry entry = scheduler.schedule(namespace);\r\nMap cache = entry.getCache();\r\n...\r\nentry.close();\r\n```\r\n3. `ExtractionNamespaceCacheFactory` and subclasses are changed so they now create a new cache and populate it only after they identify that they are not up-to-date. If they are up-to-date, they create nothing. Before, a cache was first created, and then passed to `populateCache()`, which could do nothing, because the lookup is up-to-date.\r\n\r\n**Result**\r\n 1.\r\n - Don't use intrinsic locks in this subsystem at all (before they were used in several places on several kinds of objects)\r\n - Just one `ConcurrentMap` left (not counting caches themselves), in `OnHeapNamespaceExtractionCacheManager` (before there were ~4 ConcurrentMaps in `NamespaceExtractionCacheManager` alone, also in OnHeap and OffHeap subclasses.\r\n 2. `CacheHandler`s and `CacheScheduler`'s Entries are provided with `Cleaner`s, i. e. if some `CacheHandler` or `CacheScheduler.Entry` is not closed, it will be identified, logged as error, and resources disposed.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n - Some tests use PowerMock now, to be able to mock final classes.\r\n - Some classes (e. g. `NamespaceExtractionCacheManagerExecutorsTest`) were not renamed in order not to break the git history and minimise diff of this PR. But their names are quite misleading now. I'm going to rename the classes in a different PR (along with renames promised here:

PR includes several related fixes/refactorings around `Sequences` subsystem, in the importance order:\r\n\r\n 1. Make `Sequences.withBaggage()` and `Sequences.withEffect()` to consistently close the baggage and execute the effect _after_ base sequence is closed. Before, it was so in `accumulate()` path but was the opposite in `Yielder` path. This in mentioned in #3563.\r\n 2. Fixed potential defect in `SpecificSegmentQueryRunner`, which catches `MissingSegmentsException` in `toYielder()` but doesn't catch exception in `Yielder.next()`.  This fix develops the idea of #3617. Probably it could never be an issue in practice, because if the segment is missing, `MissingSegmentsException` should always be thrown from `toYielder()`. But I'm not sure.\r\n 3. Add `Sequences.wrap()` which allows to simplify and remove repetitive code from `MetricsEmittingQueryRunner`,  `CPUTimeMetricQueryRunner` and `SpecificSegmentQueryRunner`.\r\n 4. Review exception handling in `Sequences` subsystem\r\n 5. Remove unused classes from `io.druid.java.util.common.guava` package.\r\n 6. Try to create sequences via factory methods from `Sequences` class rather than constructing XxxSequence classes directory; reduce visibility of the latter

is code corresponding to the proposal at: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/druid-development/3npt9Qxpjr0/F-t--qMNBQAJ\r\n\r\nIt includes:\r\n\r\n- Calcite-based parser and planner.\r\n- Documentation in https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/sql/docs/content/querying/sql.md and https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/sql/docs/content/configuration/broker.md\r\n- A semi-join implementation that is goofy but lovable.\r\n- Metadata support through SegmentMetadataQueries.\r\n- Test suite with lots of test SQLs (including some that are known not to work).\r\n\r\nThere's 2 ways of issuing SQL queries, both on the broker:\r\n- JSON API on /druid/v2/sql/\r\n- [Avatica server](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/avatica_overview.html) at /druid/v2/sql/avatica/\r\n\r\nSQL querying is disabled by default in this PR, since enabling it causes brokers to make some extra metadata queries. I expect the extra load will be small, but I'm wanting to be conservative.\r\n\r\nThis depends on the latest Calcite (1.10.0) although there are some features that will only work when 1.11.0 is released. These are marked with `CALCITE_1_11_0` in CalciteQueryTest.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks shows minimal overhead for our benchmark queries. I expect there to be some overhead since SQL planning takes some time, and also we're going through Calcite's JDBC adapter on the output side. That could potentially be bypassed in a future patch.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                 (rowsPerSegment)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlBenchmark.queryNative             10000  avgt   30    16.588 ±  0.283  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.queryNative            100000  avgt   30   920.364 ± 18.956  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.queryNative            200000  avgt   30  3604.093 ± 58.809  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql                10000  avgt   30    35.641 ± 30.452  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql               100000  avgt   30   960.524 ± 60.775  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql               200000  avgt   30  3665.385 ± 48.119  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo consider for future patches:\r\n\r\n- Make the SQL language extendable, so we can add new functions in extensions.\r\n- Potentially bypass Calcite's JDBC adapter, just using it for parsing and planning.\r\n- Support for more Druid and SQL features.\r\n\r\nThe original PR had some questions, which are answered in the latest diff:\r\n\r\n- Should SQL querying be enabled by default? **(Latest diff: no, it's not enabled by default)**\r\n- Should background metadata fetching be enabled by default? See DruidSchema.java for how this is done. Basically the broker will issue SegmentMetadataQueries (with a throttle) when it notices new dataSources or new segments. There's a case to be made that even with a throttle, we shouldn't enable this by default (principle of least surprise for upgrading clusters). There's also a case to be made that we should enable it by default, and call out in the release notes how to turn it off (principle of ease of use for new users). **(Latest diff: background metadata fetching is enabled if SQL is, but SQL is disabled by default)**\r\n- If background metadata fetching is turned off, what happens when someone issues a SQL query?

push the task logs to HDFS which fill up the scarce namespace and whose deletion is currently managed outside of Druid. This is a major inconvenience to most of the teams using Druid and most of them are deleting those manually.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a feature to configure Overlord to automatically delete older task logs. See updates to `docs/content/configuration/indexing-service.md` for the user documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, implementation is only provided for local and hdfs type tasklogs.\r\n\r\nFramework introduced can be used to manage retention of other tasks related persisted state but that is for the future.","created_at":"2016-11-10T17:01:36Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:46Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T23:18:56Z","merged_at":"2016-12-21T23:18:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ca3b7f1e43245f59737756201d037c5b7d0e8a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21/labels","id":1831000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTgzMTAwMA==","number":21,"title":"0.10.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":310,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-15T22:35:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T17:41:02Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/8293b42102ba03c6d491d57aa7460f18feb2fa6c","head":{"label":"himanshug:tasklog_cleaner","ref":"tasklog_cleaner","sha":"8293b42102ba03c6d491d57aa7460f18feb2fa6c","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23076411,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzA3NjQxMQ==","name":"druid","full_name":"himanshug/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug/druid","description":"Real²time

PR addresses 3 issues:\r\n1. Replace DateTime to Long if it used as a key in a Map b/c of some issues described below.\r\n2. Document caveats surrounding timezoned segments\r\n3. Fix an issue where `hashed` partitions doesn't respect timzone when creating the partitions.json file.\r\n\r\n**Replacing DateTime with Long as map key**\r\nWhen you use DateTime as key for the map, you'll see unexpected behavior when DateTime has timezone associated.\r\n\r\nFor example: Here's a piece of code that fails when compiled with `-Duser.timezone=UTC` setting. \r\n```\r\nDateTime odt = DateTime.now(DateTimeUtils.getZone(DateTimeZone.forID(\"America/Los_Angeles\")));\r\nHashMap<DateTime, String> map = new HashMap<>();\r\nmap.put(odt, \"abc\");\r\nDateTime dt = new DateTime(odt.getMillis());\r\nSystem.out.println(map.get(dt));  // will print null\r\n```\r\nWith the above, simple DateTime lookup fails. DateTime sometimes uses YYYY-MM-DDT07:00:00Z vs YYYY-MM-DDT:00:00:000-07:00Z as the key although both point to the same instant in time.\r\n\r\nSo replacing the key to be a Long, is more predictable and addresses this issue. I've tried to replace all the places in the code where DateTime is used as key.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to apply timezones to the intervals to produce timezoned segments, it breaks because of this bug.\r\n\r\n**Caveats around timezoned segments**\r\nSince the timezone is respected only for batch ingestion with explicitly specified intervals, I've updated the docs to call out that timezoned segments are not supported for realtime kafka ingestion and if intervals are not specified for batch ingestion.\r\n\r\n**partitions.json doesn't respect timezone with hashed partition**\r\nAlso, DetermineHashedPartitionsJob creates the partitions.json file under the directory that isn't timezone specific. This is because SegmentGranularity's getBucket() doesn't respect timezone whereas getBucketInterval() from the SegmentGranularitySpec does. So I ended up using that instead. I believe the intervals have 1-1 correspondence with the segments being

thetaSketch module has 3 different type of sketch representations that are passed around for performance reasons. This patch consolidates all the different sketch representations into single SketchHolder which handles all the messiness of different representations and remaining module only worries about SketchHolder.\r\n\r\nAside from refactoring, one major advantage of SketchHolder is to be able to cache the finalized sketch and estimates which improves performance of topN queries because they would add things to priority queue and estimates are computed repeatedly via comparator to place them in correct location on the priority queue. Its hard to quantify this one though.\r\n\r\nThis patch is fully backward and forward

It is very fast and good enough for the intended use case of dev/testing environments.\r\nHowever, ideally, segments should be deleted by iterating the records in druid_segments table and then deleting their files one by one (because, in theory, they could be stored in different locations in different deep storages).

it's hard to validate if different versions of Druid generate the same data for a segment. For example, if null-handling changes then segment sizes and dimension offsets in metadata can be different between two segments. I added a cli tool that utilizes `io.druid.segment.IndexIO` to validate segments which can be used as following:\r\n```\r\nio.druid.cli.Main tools validate-segments /Users/jisookim/druid/validation/prev-segment Users/jisookim/druid/validation/curr-segment\r\n```\r\nwhere `prev-segment` and `curr-segment` are directories that consist of segment files (version.bin, etc).\r\n\r\nWhile doing this, I found bugs in `StringDimensionHandler.validateSortedEncodedArrays()` that could lead incorrect validation. The first is to throw dimension value lengths not equal exception when the lengths are actually equal. The second is the following `continue` statement:\r\n```\r\nif (dIdex1 == dIdex2) {\r\n  continue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above statement reduces the validation runtime, but in a case of any changes in encodings including null-handling, it could potentially result in incorrect validation since dimension values could be mapped

user wants to enlarge the segment size in realtime task and rebuild from some checkpoint, like kafka offset, like from hour to day without using new version (the default versioning policy is the IntervalStartVersioningPolicy, will use same version when rebuild), it causes 'can't overlap error' in broker and coordinator when user starts the new tasks before the old segments are disabled from druid (there is some delay from disabled to removed from serverView), and 'No servers found for SegmentDescriptor'.\r\nEven worse, if user want's to fix these error by killing the new task and restore the old config, it still fails because of 'can't overlap error' again.\r\n\r\nIt's caused by the inconsistent state of all allTimelineEntries/completePartitionsTimeline/selectors when the first time  'can't overlap error'  occurred.\r\nThe new segments are added to allTimelineEntries/completePartitionsTimeline, but not the selectors, user can't remove the new segments from allTimelineEntries/completePartitionsTimeline by killing the task due to selectors doesn't contain the new segments and refuse to clean the timelines.\r\n\r\nWe can just simply fix this issue by always trying to clean the timelines, thus user can kill the task, clean the timeline, disable the old segments and start the new task

PR is the same of #3357\r\n\r\nThis patch provides the integration of Druid & [Netflix Exhibitor](https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor/wiki).\r\n\r\nExhibitor is a supervisor system for ZooKeeper. Exhibitor can dynamically scale-up/down the cluster of ZooKeeper servers. Druid currently use Apache Curator as ZooKeeper client. Curator can be integrated with Exhibitor to achieve a live/updating list of the ZooKeeper ensemble. For details, please refer to [this link](http://curator.apache.org/exhibitor.html).\r\n\r\nI want to use Exhibitor-supervised Zookeeper cluster for Druid.

PR introduces a number of improvements to the IndexTask (non-Hadoop batch indexer). The primary motivation of improving IndexTask is with the view that it can be used with something like #1998 for automatic merging and splitting of segments for users without Hadoop. This would replace the functionality of the MergeTask which is limited by the fact that it can only operate on NoneShardSpec-type segments. Secondary motivation is to improve the performance/stability of IndexTask for users who don't run a Hadoop cluster.\n\nMain changes:\n- Overall performance: Old implementation iterated through entire data set once to determine intervals, once to determine shards for that interval, and once to generate index for each shard; hence if your segmentGranularity resulted in 12 time intervals and each interval had 3 shards, the _entire dataset_ was read from 1 + 12 + 36 times. This has been reduced to either 1 time if `numShards` and `intervals` is provided, otherwise 2 times. Performance gains will vary based on number of intervals/shards, but in all cases are better than the previous implementation and typically significantly better. Performance compared to Hadoop index task running locally is typically equivalent or better. The Appenderator implementation is now being used for index generation.\n- ReplayableFirehose: Introduced a new firehose wrapper type that entirely consumes the wrapped firehose into temporary files and then serves read requests from the cached data. This has a few benefits:\n  - In the case that we need to read the data more than once, it prevents us from fetching from remote resources multiple times (saves time, potentially money)\n  - In the case that we need to read the data more than once, it gives us deterministic results where the wrapped firehose may not\n  - In the case that the underlying firehose is unreliable, it allows us to retriably grab the entire dataset first and only begin serving data after we have a full copy (this addresses a number of issues recently reported with the S3 firehose failing in the middle of reading)\n  - I did not document the ReplayableFirehose, even though it could theoretically wrap any other firehose because I'm not sure how much use it has outside of the index task. IndexTask wraps any provided firehose in a ReplayableFirehose, although this behavior can be disabled by configuration.\n- segmentGranularity `intervals` no longer needs to be explicitly provided but can be determined, which could make things easier for some use cases\n- Append support: Users can set the `appendToExisting` flag which will generate segments that are additional partitions added to the latest version of the existing segments, effectively 'appending data' into the datasource. The set of segments to be appended to must be an extendable-type (i.e. they can't be NoneShardSpecs).\n- Reworked IndexTuningConfig to have similarly-named parameters to other index task types: If people agree with this change, it is backwards-incompatible and would require users to update their ingestion specs.\n\nThis PR depends on #3483 being merged and I don't expect tests to pass until that happens.\n","created_at":"2016-10-26T00:21:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:42Z","closed_at":"2017-01-18T22:24:37Z","merged_at":"2017-01-18T22:24:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff52581bd305c8b64d4f040cc37fa8310fc69ef3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

the non-thread-safety of HyperLogLogCollector, it is actually currently used\nby multiple threads during realtime indexing. HyperUniquesAggregator's \"aggregate\" and\n\"get\" methods can be called simultaneously by OnheapIncrementalIndex, since its\n\"doAggregate\" and \"getMetricObjectValue\" methods are not synchronized.\n\nThis means that the optimization of HyperLogLogCollector.fold in #3314 (saving and\nrestoring position rather than duplicating the storage buffer of the right-hand side)\ncould cause corruption in the face of concurrent writes.\n\nThis patch works around the issue by duplicating the storage buffer in \"get\" before\nreturning a collector. The returned collector still shares data with the original one,\nbut the situation is no worse than before #3314. In the future we may want to consider\nmaking a thread safe version of HLLC that avoids these kinds of problems in realtime\nindexing. But for now I thought it was best to do a small change that restored the old\nbehavior.\n\nFixes
