support for passing typesafe config string as part of environment variables. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently to configure OpenWhisk settings in Controller and Invoker one needs to reverse map the typesafe config to environment variable following specific convention. For example setting `whisk.loadbalancer.invoker-busy-threshold` would need env name like `CONFIG_whisk_loadbalancer_invokerBusyThreshold`. This currently works but poses following problems\r\n\r\n1. Mapping config name to env name has some transformation involved and is a manual process\r\n2. Flattening the config tree in env variables obscures the config and makes it tricky to get the context\r\n3. Mapping list entries in config to env variable is tricky\r\n\r\nIt would be better to have a way where we can pass in the config from a file in typesafe config format to the container via some environment variable. This brings back all the [benefits of typesafe config](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#goals--background) for custom config.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis PR currently does not convert the existing ansible setup to switch to config format and just enables someone to use the new approach.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1 - Config in File\r\n\r\nDefine the required config in a file. This can also be a jinja template\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude classpath(\"application.conf\")\r\n\r\nwhisk {\r\n  couchdb {\r\n    protocol = \"{{ db.protocol }}\"\r\n    host     = \"{{ db.host }}\"\r\n    port     = \"{{ db.port }}\"\r\n    username = \"{{ db.username }}\"\r\n    password = \"{{ db.password }}\"\r\n    databases {\r\n      WhiskAuth       = \"{{ db.whisk.auth }}\"\r\n      WhiskEntity     = \"{{ db.whisk.actions }}\"\r\n      WhiskActivation = \"{{ db.whisk.activations }}\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2 - Configure env variable\r\n\r\nConfigure env variable `OPENWHISK_CONFIG` with content of  above file\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Load config from template\r\n  set_fact:\r\n      openwhisk_config: \"{{ lookup('template', 'config.j2') }}\"\r\n\r\n- name: populate environment variables for controller\r\n  set_fact:\r\n    env:\r\n      \"OPENWHISK_CONFIG\": \"{{ openwhisk_config }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this at runtime config would also include config provided from the config file in addition to config set via env variables\r\n\r\n### Implementation Detail \r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `transformEnvironment.sh` to copy the content of `OPENWHISK_CONFIG` to file `/openwhisk.conf` on file system. It also configures the system property `-Dconfig.file='/openwhisk.conf` which makes [typesafe config logic load](https://github.com/lightbend/config#standard-behavior) this file. \r\n \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nInstead of restricting connection reuse, destroy connection pool on Container.pause.\r\nPartly from discussion at https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3969#issuecomment-413590542\r\nand partly to enable connection reuse to prep for concurrent activations (#2795)\r\nwe should not constraint connection handling at the client, but rather dispose the connection pool at time of pause (since it may leave the client pool in a bad state if the container is paused then resumed) \r\n\r\n(replaces

marker.  For runtimes that inject this sentinel line into their\r\noutputs, it becomes quite simple to do an asynchronous stream processing\r\noperation on their log streams and forward log lines enriched with activation ids\r\nto a platform logging service.\r\n\r\nAlso add a Fluent Bit configuration/script and Dockerfile to process logs in this format.\r\n\r\nAppended is an example from an action that

removal of base64 for json responses from PR #3939\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nrecent PR #3919 added the ability for web actions to specify a `string` type in the `body` of the response and removed the support for the legacy requirement of handing base64.\r\nWe got feedback from users that they have webactions with this old behavior in place and their actions were not working as expected.\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction main(params){\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\r\n    body: new Buffer(JSON.stringify(params)).toString('base64')\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis requirement was removed a year ago from code also documentation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to restore the base64, and announce of the braking change to user to give a period for them to update their webactions and remove this extra step of doing base64 for JSON not need it.\r\n\r\nUser can still return a json/dict object body a common case\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction main(params){\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\r\n    body: param\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUser can use the new way of returning a `string` if they want to avoid to parse into a object or dict\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction main(params){\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\r\n    body: '{\"hello\":\"world\"}'\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nIn systems with a lot of invokers, all Kafka-consumers are slowing down Kafka if they are ideling.\r\n\r\nI did some tests with the fetch.max.wait.ms-parameter.\r\nI produce messages to one topic. Each consumer has it’s own topic. So if there are 100 consumers, 99 of them are idling.\r\nI used the command kafka-producer-perf-test.sh --topic invoker0 --num-records 100000 --throughput 999999999 --record-size 600 --producer-props bootstrap.servers=localhost:9072 for the test.\r\n\r\n|               |           20ms           |           100ms          |           500ms          |          1000ms          |\r\n|:-------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\r\n|  1 consumers  | 39698.292973 records/sec | 40225.261464 records/sec | 39047.247169 records/sec |                          |\r\n|  10 consumers | 39936.102236 records/sec | 39729.837108 records/sec | 42625.745951 records/sec |                          |\r\n|  50 consumers | 25144.581343 records/sec | 36324.010171 records/sec | 39603.960396 records/sec |                          |\r\n| 100 consumers | 16860.563143 records/sec | 28425.241615 records/sec | 35435.861091 records/sec | 36616.623947 records/sec |\r\n\r\nOn the test-machine, a got these numbers. The only changes were made in the amount of consumers and topics and the parameter `fetch.max.wait`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the procuder can write much more messages to Kafka, if the idling consumers are having a higher `fetch.max.wait`.\r\n\r\nAs `fetch.min.bytes` is set to 1, there should be no latency-impact on executing activations.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nThe existing description of updating bash on macOS tells users to install an updated bash by installing `bash-completion` via brew. The `bash-completion` package is not bash itself; it is a set of completion definitions for various programs. To actually get a newer bash, users should do `brew install bash` instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a line to clarify that the updated bash is installed in `/usr/local/bin` (as opposed to updating the system default bash).\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [X] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [X] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [ ] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [X] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [ ] I added tests to cover my changes. *This is a doco-only change; no relevant tests to add.*\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [X] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-15T23:50:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T09:07:13Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T09:07:13Z","merged_at":"2018-08-29T09:07:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0d975d49b0ea7e04768ea60fd3abe3b91c99fbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":358826865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTg4MjY4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c5def5","default":true,"description":null},{"id":401833916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDE4MzM5MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/review","name":"review","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Review

intermittent build failures in various runtimes that use `ActionContainer` for tests (which uses the akka http client as of recently) shows some errors where connections are prematurely terminated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn separate testing, I think this is related to use of `Connection: close` request header, to dissuade connection reuse.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n* removes `Connection:close` header\r\n* uses instead the `SO.KeepAlive(false)` (SocketOption); similar to the apache client setting to disable connection reuse\r\n\r\nSince Akka client is not enabled by default in existing code except the `ActionContainer` test base class, this change and its affects are not obvious, until runtimes using this test class are running on this change. Locally testing, I was able to intermittently reproduce problems with the previous version, and have not seen problems with this new version.\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

   \r\n    1. Upgrade to latest released version of the fabric8 Kubernetes client\r\n       to get access to an implementation of node affinity.

This eliminates the last\r\n       usage of kubectl in the KubernetesClient and allows the kubectl\r\n       executable to be removed from the invoker Docker

action code as attachment for all kinds in default runtime.\r\n\r\nSupersedes #3286. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on #3286 and enables use of attachment mode for all kinds. Some key aspects are\r\n\r\n1. Binary code (like zip/jar) is stored in raw form (NOT Base64 encoded) in attachment\r\n2. Change is backward compatible in reading code\r\n3. Upon update or new action being created the code would be stored as attachment\r\n4. `attachmentType` property of runtime.json is now not used. Instead one of the below is used\r\n    - `text/plain(UTF-8)` - For plain string which are not base64 encoded\r\n    - `application/octet-stream` - For codes which are Base64 string. Such codes are stored in raw form in persistent store\r\n\r\nNote that with support for attachment inlining (#3709) it may happen that small code is still stored as part of same document (but in attachment object format)\r\n\r\n### Forms of code\r\n\r\nCode related to an action can be stored in following forms\r\n\r\n#### String property\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"java\",\r\n    \"code\": \"ZHViZWU=\",\r\n    \"binary\": true,\r\n    \"main\": \"hello\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Blackbox action also the code is stored as string property\r\n\r\n```json\r\n {\r\n \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"blackbox\",\r\n    \"image\": \"docker-custom.com/openwhisk-runtime/magic/nodejs:0.0.1\",\r\n    \"binary\": false,\r\n    \"code\": \"\\\"use strict\\\";\\n\\nvar fs = require('fs');...\"\r\n  }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Attachment\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"java\",\r\n    \"code\": {\r\n      \"attachmentName\": \"couch:f41be90d-5656-47f5-9be9-0d5656f7f555\",\r\n      \"attachmentType\": \"application/java-archive\",\r\n      \"length\": 32768,\r\n      \"digest\": \"sha256-5a373715b8cdcd608059debe9dae2ad95087eb5322321d1d0b862f8330a0e54d\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"binary\": true,\r\n    \"main\": \"hello\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Potential Performance Impact\r\n\r\nCurrently for non java kinds the code is stored as part of same document. With this change the code may be (if size > `max-inline-size`) stored as attachment. Due to this in case of action invocation if there is a cache miss then it would require 2 remote calls to load the whole action compared to 1 remote call currently.\r\n\r\nNote that post #2855 the attachments are now also cached. So if more new containers need to be spinned then they would not incur any further performance impact till action is cached.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nWith this change it would be possible to store larger codes for setups using store which place restriction on maximum document size.\r\n\r\nFurther it also improves the heap usage for normal cases where the code is not required to be loaded. See #2847\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Review `moveCodeToAttachment.py`\r\n- [x] Add more compatability tests\r\n- [ ] Review default inline size\r\n- [x] Restore support for `jar` property name\r\n- [x] Use `application/octet-stream` for binary code. Even for jars and `text/plain` for non binary code\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3944)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nToday the gatling tests hard code the amount and percentage of errors, like:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tests/performance/gatling_tests/src/gatling/scala/ColdBlockingInvokeSimulation.scala#L88\r\n\r\nThe PR is making the number of errors and percentage configurable per environment variable. For example during long running tests with lot of requests a certain amount of failure rate is acceptable.\r\n\r\nI can extend this to other tests once first review is ok. Give me a ping...\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [ ] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\nI've run a test that the parameters are recognised as expected.\r\n```\r\nOPENWHISK_HOST=\"xxxxxx\" USERS=\"10\" REQUESTS_PER_SEC=\"10\" MAX_ERRORS_ALLOWED=\"1\" MAX_ERRORS_ALLOWED_PERCENTAGE=\"0.1\" ./gradlew gatlingRun-ColdBlockingInvokeSimulation\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult\r\n```\r\nInvoke action: mean requests per second is greater than 10.0 : true\r\nInvoke action: count of failed requests is less than or equal to 1.0 : true\r\nInvoke action: percentage of failed requests is less than or equal to 0.1 : true\r\n```","created_at":"2018-08-03T14:44:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T14:12:02Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T14:12:02Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T14:12:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"92a4a0c314821681043716cc601b64d543f61e80","assignee":{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":401833916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDE4MzM5MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/review","name":"review","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Review

a container on applicationError (graceful error from action), only during /run (any error during /init still destroys the container)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn the Future handling of `ContainerProxy.initializeAndRun()`, this adjustment will allow container to NOT be destroyed when applicationError is returned from the /run request.\r\n\r\nThis affects warm container reuse in the case where an anticipated error should produce an error result, but should have no impact on container reuse (container is still valid to process next activation). \r\nExample use case is parameter validation where some sanity check is performed at the start of the action code, and immediately returns `{error: \"invalid parameter\"}`.\r\n\r\nThis will\r\n* NOT affect the API/client results (error is still seen on any error from container)\r\n* improve container reuse (since preemptively failing based on user input will no longer cause container destruction)\r\n\r\nI considered, but did NOT implement, a change to `WhiskActivation` to add a field that indicates /init failure - since I think it can only be detected in activation logs whether the applicationError response was during /init vs /run, and it may be useful for action developers to have easier access to this bit of info. Sone of the code is convoluted to track the distinction between _applicationError on /init_ and _applicationError on /run_ (e.g. `WhiskActivation` becomes`(WhiskActivation, Boolean)`).\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3918 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\nConductor actions currently abort when they fail to execute a component action with no possibility to catch the error and recover.

proposition is to get rid of Kafka, have controller and invoker compiled together into a \"lean\" controller-invoker (have a Gradle project for that) with controller calling the invoker's method directly via an in-memory object (a queue, which is also loaded via SPI) via a new pluggable load balancer that is selected via SPI using configuration file property setting. For more information here is a [blog](https://medium.com/@davidbr_9022/lean-openwhisk-open-source-faas-for-edge-computing-fb823c6bbb9b)\r\nAs well, briefly discussed it in this [thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/516efc0ed9afb09fe52e30d10eb9fe5091af91df53a46c07e1701122@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe goal is to avoid changes in the core components as much as possible. Rather this PR adds a few components. The main additions are as follows:\r\n- LeanBalancer SPI: provides LoadBalancer to communicate with Invoker directly without Kafka in the middle (Invoker does not exist as a separate entity; it is built together with Controller)\r\n- LeanMessagingProvider SPI: provides Producer/Consumer implementers to communicate via in-memory queue instead of Kafka.\r\n- Ansible deployment: added controller-lean.yml and other files required for the Ansible deployment. Since lean controller is a combination of the controller + invoker projects, its ansible deploy.yml requires most of the values from both. Currently this problem is resolved by partially replicating variables from the regular invoker's deploy.yml to the tasks/invoker-lean.yml. Probably it would be better to avoid this duplication by having everything we need for lean in the regular deploy.yml. \r\n- Dockerfile: to build Lean controller docker image, which is a merge of the regular invoker + controller Dockerfile\r\n- Vagrantfile: a small change to make Lean available using environment variable\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n-

\r\n\r\nBecause when it is invoked in the browser, it doesn't resolve an action to find original fully qualified action name.  so, I added the action name resolver.\r\n\r\n#### HOW TO TEST.\r\nbind a package that contains web actions and access web action which is in the bound package using your browser, you may see errors like the image

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\nThis change wires up all existing API tests that use WskRestOperations to validate the HTTP requests and responses against the Controller API's Swagger spec.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a new Gradle task - :tests:testSwaggerCodegen - that does a basic validation of the Swagger spec and generates a basic Java client from that spec and verifies that the client compiles. CI is wired up to run this new test task.\r\n\r\nThe result of both of the above are a number of changes to the Swagger spec, also included here. This brings our Swagger spec much closer to matching the reality of the Controller API, and any additional coverage in the API test suite will further increase coverage of the Swagger spec.\r\n\r\nThere are some existing tests that purposely test API responses when passed invalid data, so the new SwaggerValidator trait includes a small whilelist of invalid requests and responses to accept so the build does not fail in these scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/openwhisk-dev/201806.mbox/%3CCAOpbpxHbSOdPpdR5t-WWTKkrTyuP%2B1c3_qeMY7vrhkfXmBYcQw%40mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

is a fairly big change but bear with me!\r\n\r\nToday, we have an arbitrary system-wide limit of maximum concurrent connections. In general that is fine, but it doesn't have a direct correlation to what's actually happening in the system.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new state to each monitored invoker: Overloaded. An invoker will go into overloaded state if active-acks are starting to timeout. Eventually, if the system is really overloaded, all Invokers will be in overloaded state which will cause the loadbalancer to return a failure. This failure now results in a `503 - System overloaded` message back to the user.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [X] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
