The surface api of BeamSql includes the following:\r\n  * BeamSql\r\n  * BeamSqlCli\r\n  * BeamSqlEnv\r\n  * All the classes in package `org.apache.beam.dsls.sql.schema`\r\n* Calcite related methods are encapsulated into `CalciteUtils`(which is not part of surface api) to avoid exposure.\r\n* Created a new `BeamSqlTable` interface which abstracts the beam `table` concept.\r\n* `RelDataType`, `RelProtoDataType` are all removed from surface api, `BeamSqlRecordType` is the only class which represents the schema of a table.\r\n  * java.sql.Types is used to represent sql type instead of Calcite `SqlTypeName`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-14T15:50:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T01:36:29Z","closed_at":"2017-06-16T01:36:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2372cad85e5af624adc6ad929e9741ac7adddd62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c0c4fd57ca472e8423d4d38bd29970c9755c1165","head":{"label":"xumingming:BEAM-2442-api-surface-test","ref":"BEAM-2442-api-surface-test","sha":"c0c4fd57ca472e8423d4d38bd29970c9755c1165","user":{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90008711,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDAwODcxMQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"xumingming/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming/beam","description":"Mirror
