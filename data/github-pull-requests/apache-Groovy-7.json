PR fixes the mentioned issue and implements tests to make sure the issue does not surface again.\r\n\r\n## Some details\r\n\r\nThis bug was actually a compiler bug. When inserting constants to the Java Bytecode, Groovy compiler checks if a float is 0.0f and inserts the instruction for this special constant in case it is. However, the `==` operator works according to the IEEE-754 standard, and compares negative and positive zero as equal. So, if there's a negative zero (-0.0f) in the original Groovy code, the instruction for a positive float would be inserted in the bytecode.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by using `Float.equals()` instead, which, according to the [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#equals-java.lang.Object-), does not compare negative and positive zero as equal.\r\n\r\nThis PR was a joint effort by four

is quite a history to `findParameterizedType` and related methods.  I did not fully understand the reason for some of the looser checks.  I think they were to account for incomplete generics, which are now more complete.  Rather then building the whole type hierarchy at once, I took an approach of build as needed.  This should reduce some of the cost of searching.  I would have reduced the method count further, but it's all public api now.","created_at":"2021-02-16T21:16:58Z","updated_at":"2021-03-21T14:44:04Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T18:53:26Z","merged_at":"2021-02-17T18:53:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b87f7c65a70b1d57c9f92e04f8d16daf3c2ab12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/1d1696cad0303d0f4abe09fcd9b15ba88d5f5f87","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-9945","ref":"GROOVY-9945","sha":"1d1696cad0303d0f4abe09fcd9b15ba88d5f5f87","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
