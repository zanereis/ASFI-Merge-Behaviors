our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06762) on GPU ops/subgraphs.\r\nThe complete search policy still waits for the feature extraction & cost model support, so this will be a basic search policy using random cost model.\r\n\r\nWe'll continue to work on the upstreaming process to bring the complete auto schedule support for various workloads on CPU/GPU with some reproducible performance results, a custom sketch rule support to work like the AutoTVM, as well as the tutorials of how to play with AutoScheduler.\r\n\r\n## Review guide\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n- Add PreloadMeasuredStates\r\n- Split the Python API of search_policy to a separate file `search_policy.py`\r\n- Bug fix on `auto_scheduler.auto_schedule` returning empty state\r\n- Bug fix for measure record. The former implementation used the default `std::vector<int>` handler, which output multiple lines when the array size is larger than 10\r\n- ~~A brief tutorial for CPU that used RandomModel, **the

    I am a mlsys engineer who mainly provides server support for the nlp-related model for the company. In the nlp-related business scenario, we found that tvm can provide superior tensor computing performance, so we intend to promote tvm applications within the company.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, we prefer to integrate more business processing operations with **tvm relay** and provide end-to-end solutions.\r\n\r\n    Currently, TVM already provides data type support such as String/Array/Map at the Runtime level, but there is no corresponding interface at the **relay ir** level, and we sincerely hope to provide corresponding support at the relay level.\r\n\r\n    We want to do this in three stages:\r\n    1) Add String IR types and support easy operation of String \r\n    2) Add Array IR types and support easy operation of Array \r\n    3) Add MapIR types and support easy operation of Map \r\n\r\n    In this PR, we have add String type, hoping to get community support and feedback, and if possible, merge to tvm master, which can reduce branch maintenance costs here. \r\n\r\n

is the first of 3 PRs to introduce the Ethos-N integration into TVM via the BYOC framework. It adds support for partitioning and compiling for the Ethos-N77 target with CPU fallback for unsupported operators. Additionally, runtime support is added in the form of an Ethos-N runtime module. In this initial PR, only quantized concatenate and split are supported with follow-up PRs adding support for many further operators.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Leo Blonk <Leo.Blonk@arm.com> @Leo-arm

reference to [this RFC](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-incorporate-existing-relay-aot-compiler-in-mainline/7393), this PR is intended to incorporate the existing external [Relay ahead-of-time (AoT) compiler](https://github.com/uwsampl/relay-aot), which was primarily written by @MarisaKirisame, into TVM. To start, I am simply including most of the files from the AoT compiler repo nearly verbatim, though the interfaces should be changed to better adhere to the high-level vision for TVM (especially since the initial code comes from a research prototype).\r\n\r\nThe prototype AoT compiler operates by translating Relay ASTs directly into C++ code and using TVM's JIT compiler to register all primitive functions (i.e., the C++ code calls into TVM's operator cache to handle operators). This results in producing a C++ file and requires calling the system's C++ compiler (in the prototype, assuming it to be `clang`).\r\n\r\nI would be curious to hear others' thoughts (e.g., @jroesch @weberlo @tqchen) about how this compiler can be better integrated into TVM's systems. Based on the discussion in the RFC, it sounds that the interface should be made to take an IRModule and produce a runtime module that can call the compiled functions. Ideally the system could be made modular to allow for target languages other than

mentioned a PR before, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6000, but because of my mistake, I merged the master branch. In order to correct this mistake, I propose this pr.\r\n\r\nPlease forgive me for my mistakes and help to review this pr, thanks you very much!\r\n@tqchen @FrozenGene @siju-samuel \r\n\r\n### Background & Motivation\r\n\r\n[Caffe](<https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/>) is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. Because of its simplicity, good scalability, fast and other characteristics, it is favored by many people. According to [riselab]( https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) who makes statistics of papers collected in arxiv.org, Caffe is ranked in the top four in the deep learning framework, which shows to some extent that Caffe's user base is still large, please refer to [blog](<https://www.oreilly.com/content/one-simple-graphic-researchers-love-pytorch-and-tensorflow/>). In addition, according to our company's research on the market, the demand for Caffe in the production environment is still strong, and many models based on Caffe need to be deployed. For example, existing deployment frameworks, such as [MNN](<https://github.com/alibaba/MNN>), [NCNN](<https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn>), [MACE](<https://github.com/XiaoMi/mace>), etc., directly support the deployment of Caffe.\r\n\r\nTVM only supports caffe2 at present, and the difference between Caffe and caffe2 is quite large. At present, there are two ways to deploy Caffe model in TVM: one is to convert Caffe model to Tensorflow or Pytorch model, the other is to convert Caffe model to onnx and then to relay IR. The two methods are essentially the same. They are all indirectly converted to relay IR through the third-party transformation. However, the problem is that some ops will fail in the process of model transformation, and even the result of transfer out may be different.\r\n\r\nBased on the above situation, we decided to open our Caffe frontend codes, hoping to enrich the use scenarios of TVM.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Approach\r\n\r\nThe whole process of Caffe front end importing model is divided into:\r\n\r\n1. Read Model：The model graph and related parameters are read through the protobuffer API of Caffe;\r\n2. Rebuild Graph：Traverse the graph, then replace the top of the in-place layer with the name of the layer, and update all related layers at the same time;\r\n3. Model Conversion：Read the parameters of each layer and convert them into corresponding TVM OP and parameters;\r\n4. Layer Fusion：fuse batchnorm and scale layers;\r\n5. Convert to Relay IR：It mainly includes its module, params and the real name of the output layer。\r\n\r\nFinally, we can import the Caffe model as follows:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom google.protobuf import text_format\r\nfrom caffe.proto import caffe_pb2 as pb\r\n\r\ninit_net = pb.NetParameter()\r\npredict_net = pb.NetParameter()\r\n\r\n# load model\r\nwith open(proto_file, 'r') as f:\r\n    text_format.Merge(f.read(), predict_net)\r\n# load blob\r\nwith open(blob_file, 'rb') as f:\r\n    init_net.ParseFromString(f.read())\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'data': [1,3,224,224]}\r\ndtype_dict = {'data': 'float32'}\r\n\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_caffe(init_net, predict_net, shape_dict, dtype_dict)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Work Done\r\n\r\nAll of the things that we have done are listed as following:\r\n\r\n#### 1.

is related to https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/vm-slow-compilation-of-tf-object-detection-models/7479\r\n\r\nFor TF object detection models, a module has many functions (TF SSD mobilenet has 48), where a couple of functions are pretty huge (more than 10k call nodes). FoldConstant, because it is a function pass, is called for each function in the module. However, FoldConstant also creates an Interpreter on every invocation, which currently is based on the full mod and therefore expensive.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates an interpreter for each constant subgraph. I am not sure if this is the right way. The purpose of this PR is to start a discussion and identify if there is some other higher-level design issue that needs to be resolved.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, compilation time of\r\n* SSD reduced from 955 to 453 seconds\r\n* Faster RCNN reduced from 4630 to 1227 seconds\r\n\r\n@zhiics @masahi @kevinthesun @icemelon9

calling them in c++.\r\n\r\nThe later PR will introduce a cost model based on manual features and

full upstream plan, see [Ansor RFC](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-ansor-an-auto-scheduler-for-tvm-autotvm-v2-0/7005/32).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we bring the basic Sketch search policy which is proposed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06762) on CPU ops/subgraphs.\r\nThe complete search policy still waits for the feature extraction & cost model support, so this will be a basic search policy using random cost model.\r\n\r\nWe'll continue to work on the upstreaming process to bring the complete auto schedule support for various workloads on CPU/GPU with some reproducible performance results, a custom sketch rule support to work like the AutoTVM, as well as the tutorials of how to play with AutoScheduler.\r\n\r\n## Review guide\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n- Update the API of `auto_scheduler::AutoSchedule`, `TuningOptions` and `SearchPolicy::Search`;\r\n- Some API name refine for `compute_dag.h/cc`, `cost_model.h/cc`;\r\n- Add `search_policy/sketch_search_policy.h/cc`, `search_policy/utils.h/cc`, these're the key parts of this PR;\r\n\r\nIn the SketchSearchPolicy, we can start the review from `SketchSearchPolicyNode::Search` and

PR implements both metadata parsing and converts everything to the new diagnostic machinery. \r\n\r\nI initially believed that the right way to parse the metadata table is to generate delayed references to the metadata table and then expand them after parsing is complete. In order to do this we need a piece of syntax i.e Expr, Type, Attrs, and so on for each meta reference. Currently this only works for `Expr` as I tried to define MetaRef as `op` right now in order to minimize changes.  \r\n\r\nThis brings up a bigger long term question of how much we should rely on the meta table outside of things such as the constants or other \"unprintable\" values. I realize with my tokenization approach we could eagerly expand the meta references but this requires that we have the full program on hand in order to successfully parse any program fragment.\r\n\r\nWould love to get some more thoughts and feedback cc @MarisaKirisame @joshpoll @tqchen @zhiics @electriclilies @mbrookhart @junrushao1994. \r\n\r\nFYI cc @tmoreau89
