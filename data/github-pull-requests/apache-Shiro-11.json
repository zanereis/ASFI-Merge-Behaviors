quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

[github/codeql-action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action) from 2.3.4 to 2.3.5.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.5 - 25 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow invalid URIs to be used as values to <code>artifactLocation.uri</code> properties. This reverses a change from <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a> that inadvertently led to stricter validation of some URI values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1705\">#1705</a></li>\n<li>Gracefully handle invalid URIs when fingerprinting. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1694\">#1694</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.4 - 24 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May 2023 that will disable Python dependency installation for new users of the CodeQL Action. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow invalid URIs to be used as values to <code>artifactLocation.uri</code> properties. This reverses a change from <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a> that inadvertently led to stricter validation of some URI values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1705\">#1705</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.4 - 24 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May 2023 that will disable Python dependency installation for new users of the CodeQL Action. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/244\">#244</a> Fix Maven plugin validation warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/239\">#239</a> Require Maven 3.2.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>Maven's <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/developers/compatibility-plan.html\">compatibility plan</a> marked Maven versions older than 3.2.5 as EOL in March 2023. Therefore, we now require 3.2.5 to move forward with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Fixing the validation warnings removed some Maven dependencies from the plugin's classpath (instead of using the ones from Maven itself). I'm not aware of any negative consequences of this, but it's possible certain specialized use cases might encounter changes in behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/7ea236cc5256ce9801ded45080a0109c594dcf83\"><code>7ea236c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/f5d2014df98da9b06c0f0353f22fdfeb9043801e\"><code>f5d2014</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/250\">#250</a> from groovy/guava</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/b27275c4fce28293ec7075953056eb616b404efd\"><code>b27275c</code></a> Fix Guava CVEs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/3e50f9e115ccd9267f08a8562d8f8307ddbdeb87\"><code>3e50f9e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/249\">#249</a> from groovy/remove_unneeded_dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/01b3622c51ade4f4ed05c9c39e6d9e29d6f574df\"><code>01b3622</code></a> Remove overridden dependencies no longer needed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/473d93e30662008d81f352e721d99ca6300827cc\"><code>473d93e</code></a> Add test SLF4J implementation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/96da595bb00a4c551224ee9ef08f56d4887307c6\"><code>96da595</code></a> Update plugin-plugin configuration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/31259ae954da0e38dd2336fe5b26a25c25c86960\"><code>31259ae</code></a> Clean up integration test versions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/9c99c767ebf7e7f3c8bd079839a994ca400efe51\"><code>9c99c76</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/246\">#246</a> from hazendaz/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/52187479d9819a5e767ae15b95fb47c167465a3c\"><code>5218747</code></a> Bump a couple integration test plugin versions</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/compare/2.1.0...3.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.codehaus.gmavenplus:gmavenplus-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.1.0&new-version=3.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/244\">#244</a> Fix Maven plugin validation warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/239\">#239</a> Require Maven 3.2.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>Maven's <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/developers/compatibility-plan.html\">compatibility plan</a> marked Maven versions older than 3.2.5 as EOL in March 2023. Therefore, we now require 3.2.5 to move forward with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Fixing the validation warnings removed some Maven dependencies from the plugin's classpath (instead of using the ones from Maven itself). I'm not aware of any negative consequences of this, but it's possible certain specialized use cases might encounter changes in behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/7ea236cc5256ce9801ded45080a0109c594dcf83\"><code>7ea236c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/f5d2014df98da9b06c0f0353f22fdfeb9043801e\"><code>f5d2014</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/250\">#250</a> from groovy/guava</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/b27275c4fce28293ec7075953056eb616b404efd\"><code>b27275c</code></a> Fix Guava CVEs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/3e50f9e115ccd9267f08a8562d8f8307ddbdeb87\"><code>3e50f9e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/249\">#249</a> from groovy/remove_unneeded_dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/01b3622c51ade4f4ed05c9c39e6d9e29d6f574df\"><code>01b3622</code></a> Remove overridden dependencies no longer needed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/473d93e30662008d81f352e721d99ca6300827cc\"><code>473d93e</code></a> Add test SLF4J implementation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/96da595bb00a4c551224ee9ef08f56d4887307c6\"><code>96da595</code></a> Update plugin-plugin configuration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/31259ae954da0e38dd2336fe5b26a25c25c86960\"><code>31259ae</code></a> Clean up integration test versions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/9c99c767ebf7e7f3c8bd079839a994ca400efe51\"><code>9c99c76</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/246\">#246</a> from hazendaz/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/52187479d9819a5e767ae15b95fb47c167465a3c\"><code>5218747</code></a> Bump a couple integration test plugin versions</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/compare/2.1.0...3.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.codehaus.gmavenplus:gmavenplus-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.1.0&new-version=3.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast) from 5.2.3 to 5.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.0-BETA-2</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3-BETA-2 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector for Kafka Connect source</strong>: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline\nwithout the need of a Kafka cluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Partition-Aware SQL Client</strong>:  Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.</li>\n<li><strong>Connector for MongoDB</strong>: Set up read-through/write-through caching in MongoDB via this connector without writing any code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed the <code>DataLinkFactory</code> interface as <code>DataConnection</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24224\">#24224</a></li>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nThe default configuration now connects to <a href=\"https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/%5BHazelcast\">https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/[Hazelcast</a> Viridian^] instead of Hazelcast Cloud.\nIf you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> in your configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23290\">#23290</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and <code>service-dns</code> (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster. This was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23883\">#23883</a></li>\n<li>When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)\nfor each member's pod. The discovery plugin now matches only the private IP per endpoint, ignoring the port values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23766\">#23766</a></li>\n<li>Added support of link:<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.%5BIMDSv2%5E%5D\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.[IMDSv2^]</a> for Hazelcast's AWS Discovery plugin. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23545\">#23545</a></li>\n<li>Enhanced the handling of errors coming from the Kubernetes API:\n** Not detecting the intent correctly whenever the cluster is shutdown, so the cluster was not restarted successfully.\n** Extensive amount of Kubernetes API calls were being logged when Automatic State Management feature is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23538\">#23538</a></li>\n<li>Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See [Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS].\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22411%5B#22411%5D(https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22411)\">hazelcast/hazelcast#22411</a></li>\n<li>Enhanced the experience of using Hazelcast with persistence under Kubernetes by removing requirements for manual interventions. Previously, when there is a restart on such a cluster, the cluster states were needed to be changed manually. For some cases, this might have led to data loss. Now, the shutdown process is automated. See [Configuring Kubernetes] for details. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21844\">#21844</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Disk tier option of Tiered Storage is now disabled by default. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23747\">#23747</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the Kafka connector to the distribution. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23312\">#23312</a></li>\n<li>Shaded dependencies for Hazelcast Platform have been combined in a dedicated package (<code>com.hazelcast.shaded</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23124\">#23124</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Networking</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added socket options for per-socket keep-alive configuration: <code>keep-count</code>, <code>keep-idle-seconds</code>, and <code>keep-interval-seconds</code>.\nYou can set these options using either the advanced network configurations or Hazelcast system properties.\nSee [Configuring TCP Keep-Alive]. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23816\">#23816</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24050\">#24050</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL Engine</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[29-Apr-2023]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.connect(url), natively support URLs with Unicode characters in the path or query string,\nwithout having to be escaped by the caller.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1914\">jhy/jsoup#1914</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: Calling Node.remove() on a node with no parent is now a no-op, vs a validation error.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1898\">jhy/jsoup#1898</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: aligned the HTML Tree Builder processing steps for AfterBody and AfterAfterBody to the updated WHATWG\nstandard, to not pop the stack to close <!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted --> elements.

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a

The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

1.\tRefactoring name: Extract method.\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\servlet\\SimpleCookieTest.java\\Line no. 169\r\n\r\nExplanation: The method was extracted to make the code easy to understand and the method indicates its purpose clearly.\r\n\r\n### 2.\tRefactoring name: Rename method.\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\mgt\\SimpleNamedFilterListTest.java\\Line no. 52\r\nExplanation: The original method name was not descriptive enough and did not follow the standard naming convention for test methods. The new name clearly indicates what the test is checking for.\r\n\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\RestoreSystemProperties.java\\Line no. 48\r\nExplanation: The new method name is more descriptive and follows the standard naming convention for method names.\r\n\r\n### 3.\tRefactoring name: Decompose conditional.\r\nLocation: shiro\\samples\\spring-hibernate\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\samples\\sprhib\\web\\SignupValidator.java\\Line no. 45\r\n\r\nExplanation: To decompose the complicated parts of the conditional into separate methods, I have create two methods:\r\n\r\n1.\tisEmailInvalid() - This method will take in the email address as a parameter and return a boolean value indicating whether the email is invalid or not based on the provided regular expression.\r\n2.\thasInvalidEmail() - This method will take in the command object as a parameter and call the getEmail() method to retrieve the email address. It will then use the isEmailInvalid() method to check if the email is invalid or not and return a boolean value accordingly.\r\n\r\n### 4.\tRefactoring name: Extract Class\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\HttpMethodsExtractor.java and shiro\\web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\HttpAuthenticationFilter.java\\Line no. 205\r\n\r\nExplanation: I have extracted the functionality for extracting HTTP methods from options into a new class called HttpMethodsExtractor. This class has a single public method extractHttpMethodsFromOptions that takes an array of options and returns a set of HTTP methods. The private method isHttpMethod is used internally by the extractHttpMethodsFromOptions method to check if an option is a valid HTTP method. In the HttpAuthenticationFilter class, I have created an instance of the HttpMethodsExtractor class and used it to extract HTTP methods from options in the \r\nhttpMethodsFromOptions method. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as the functionality for extracting HTTP methods is now encapsulated in a separate class.\t\r\n\r\n### 5.\tRefactoring name: Move method.\r\nLocation: web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\FormAuthenticationFilter.java\\Line no. 52 and 184\r\n\r\nExplanation: By moving the isLoginSubmission method to a separate class, we have made the code more modular and improved the cohesion of the classes. Additionally, any other classes that need to check if a request is a login submission can now use the LoginUtils class, rather than duplicating the logic in their own code.\r\n\r\n### 6.\tRefactoring name: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism\r\nLocation: src/main/java/org/apache/shiro/crypto/support/hashes/argon2/Argon2Hash.java/Line no. 212\r\n\r\nExplanation: The original code has a switch statement that checks the value of a string parameter and sets the type variable to a constant based on that value. Then, it creates an instance of Argon2Parameters using the value of type and executes the generateBytes method of Argon2BytesGenerator to generate a hash. Finally, it returns a new Argon2Hash object containing the hash and other parameters.\r\n\r\nBy replacing the switch statement with polymorphism, a common interface can be defined for all possible implementations of the generateHash method, which is responsible for generating the hash. Each subclass of Argon2Algorithm can implement the generateHash method according to the corresponding value of the string parameter, thus encapsulating the algorithm-specific logic in a single class. This way, new algorithms can be easily added by adding new subclasses without modifying the existing

name:** Replace Conditional with Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Location:** integration-tests\\jakarta-ee\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\testing\\jakarta\\ee\\Deployments.java\\Line no. 94\r\n\r\n**Link

The switch statement in the original code chooses a different course of action depending on the value of the system property INTEGRATION TEST MODE PROPERTY. This method can lead to maintenance problems, such as when new cases are introduced or when an old case needs to have its behavior changed. The switch statement may also make the code more challenging to comprehend.\r\n\r\nA hierarchy of subclasses that correspond to each situation of the switch expression can be produced by restructuring the code using polymorphism. The code is easier to understand since each subclass has functionality that is unique to that subclass's particular case.

name:** Replace Conditional with Polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Location**: integration-tests\\jakarta-ee\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\testing\\jakarta\\ee\\Deployments.java\\Line no. 94\r\n\r\n**Link of the files(s) of the previous commit (before refactoring):**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/43466afdb27ea8a611053486f253dd40457f41b4/integration-tests/jakarta-ee/src/test/java/org/apache/shiro/testing/jakarta/ee/Deployments.java#L65 \r\n\r\n**Explanation:** The switch statement in the original code chooses a different course of action depending on the value of the system property INTEGRATION TEST MODE PROPERTY. This method can lead to maintenance problems, such as when new cases are introduced or when an old case needs to have its behavior changed. The switch statement may also make the code more challenging to comprehend.\r\n\r\nA hierarchy of subclasses that correspond to each situation of the switch expression can be produced by restructuring the code using polymorphism. The code is easier to understand since each subclass has functionality that is unique to that subclass's particular case. The usage of polymorphism also improves the code's extensibility by allowing new scenarios to be introduced without changing the original code by adding new subclasses.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T03:20:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T03:23:35Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T03:23:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f10f8ce4605fa2e93935f75d20f34d9c4b99b5da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/651ade4d05ea74df06d8c6cef0e5889cf0f0c8e2","head":{"label":"vasumakwana:refactor-2","ref":"refactor-2","sha":"651ade4d05ea74df06d8c6cef0e5889cf0f0c8e2","user":{"login":"vasumakwana","id":51203941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjAzOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51203941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana","html_url":"https://github.com/vasumakwana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":622286729,"node_id":"R_kgDOJRdXiQ","name":"shiro","full_name":"vasumakwana/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vasumakwana","id":51203941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjAzOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51203941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana","html_url":"https://github.com/vasumakwana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasumakwana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vasumakwana/shiro","description":"Apache

<code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

1.\tRefactoring name: Extract method.\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\servlet\\SimpleCookieTest.java\\Line no. 169\r\n\r\nExplanation: The method was extracted to make the code easy to understand and the method indicates its purpose clearly.\r\n\r\n### 2.\tRefactoring name: Rename method.\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\mgt\\SimpleNamedFilterListTest.java\\Line no. 52\r\nExplanation: The original method name was not descriptive enough and did not follow the standard naming convention for test methods. The new name clearly indicates what the test is checking for.\r\n\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\RestoreSystemProperties.java\\Line no. 48\r\nExplanation: The new method name is more descriptive and follows the standard naming convention for method names.\r\n\r\n### 3.\tRefactoring name: Decompose conditional.\r\nLocation: shiro\\samples\\spring-hibernate\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\samples\\sprhib\\web\\SignupValidator.java\\Line no. 45\r\n\r\nExplanation: To decompose the complicated parts of the conditional into separate methods, I have create two methods:\r\n\r\n1.\tisEmailInvalid() - This method will take in the email address as a parameter and return a boolean value indicating whether the email is invalid or not based on the provided regular expression.\r\n2.\thasInvalidEmail() - This method will take in the command object as a parameter and call the getEmail() method to retrieve the email address. It will then use the isEmailInvalid() method to check if the email is invalid or not and return a boolean value accordingly.\r\n\r\n### 4.\tRefactoring name: Extract Class\r\nLocation: shiro\\web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\HttpMethodsExtractor.java and shiro\\web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\HttpAuthenticationFilter.java\\Line no. 205\r\n\r\nExplanation: I have extracted the functionality for extracting HTTP methods from options into a new class called HttpMethodsExtractor. This class has a single public method extractHttpMethodsFromOptions that takes an array of options and returns a set of HTTP methods. The private method isHttpMethod is used internally by the extractHttpMethodsFromOptions method to check if an option is a valid HTTP method. In the HttpAuthenticationFilter class, I have created an instance of the HttpMethodsExtractor class and used it to extract HTTP methods from options in the \r\nhttpMethodsFromOptions method. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as the functionality for extracting HTTP methods is now encapsulated in a separate class.\t\r\n\r\n### 5.\tRefactoring name: Move method\r\nLocation: web\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\shiro\\web\\filter\\authc\\FormAuthenticationFilter.java\\Line no. 52 and 184\r\n\r\nExplanation: By moving the isLoginSubmission method to a separate class, we have made the code more modular and improved the cohesion of the classes. Additionally, any other classes that need to check if a request is a login submission can now use the LoginUtils class, rather than duplicating the logic in their own code.\r\n\r\n### 6.\tRefactoring name: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism\r\nLocation: src/main/java/org/apache/shiro/crypto/support/hashes/argon2/Argon2Hash.java/Line no. 212\r\n\r\nExplanation: The original code has a switch statement that checks the value of a string parameter and sets the type variable to a constant based on that value. Then, it creates an instance of Argon2Parameters using the value of type and executes the generateBytes method of Argon2BytesGenerator to generate a hash. Finally, it returns a new Argon2Hash object containing the hash and other parameters.\r\n\r\nBy replacing the switch statement with polymorphism, a common interface can be defined for all possible implementations of the generateHash method, which is responsible for generating the hash. Each subclass of Argon2Algorithm can implement the generateHash method according to the corresponding value of the string parameter, thus encapsulating the algorithm-specific logic in a single class.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-03T00:18:10Z","updated_at":"2023-07-15T00:28:50Z","closed_at":"2023-07-15T00:28:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4da235e398b89819b680dafa32f5ab55c8e8799c","assignee":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2618599219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjE4NTk5MjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/shiro-2.0.0","name":"shiro-2.0.0","color":"F155AA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4619657872,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAARy8s8AAAABE1pikA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning.

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
