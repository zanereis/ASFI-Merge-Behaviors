to fix #1138 \r\n\r\n* OPC-UA keepalive threads now have an exit condition.\r\n* Both keepalive and subscription loops are now executed in their own, dedicated thread, instead of using the `ForkJoin` common pool.\r\n* Keepalive thread now uses the more sensible session timeout, instead of the 10 hour `CONNECTION_LIFETIME`. The keepalive messages are now actually sent, checked with Wireshark.\r\n* Swapped the sleep & communication logics in the keepalive thread.\r\n* Keepalive responses now increment the

The 0.12.1 fix worked, but only if the importing project or application did <em>not</em> have its own\n<code>module-info.java</code> file.</p>\n<p>This release removes that reflection code entirely in favor of a JJWT-native implementation, eliminating JPMS\nmodule (scope) problems on &gt;= JDK 17. As such, <code>--add-opens</code> flags are no longer required to use JJWT.</p>\n<p>The fix has been tested up through JDK 21 in a separate application environment (out of JJWT's codebase) to assert\nexpected functionality in a 'clean room' environment in a project both with and without <code>module-info.java</code> usage.</p>\n<h3>0.12.1</h3>\n<p>Enabled reflective access on JDK 17+ to <code>java.io.ByteArrayInputStream</code> and <code>sun.security.util.KeyUtil</code> for\n<code>jjwt-impl.jar</code></p>\n<h3>0.12.0</h3>\n<p>This is a big release! JJWT now fully supports Encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWE), JSON Web Keys (JWK) and more!  See the\nsections below enumerating all new features as well as important notes on breaking changes or backwards-incompatible\nchanges made in preparation for the upcoming 1.0 release.</p>\n<p><strong>Because breaking changes are being introduced, it is strongly recommended to wait until the upcoming 1.0 release\nwhere you can address breaking changes one time only</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those that need immediate JWE encryption and JWK key support\nhowever will likely want to upgrade now and deal with the smaller subset of breaking changes in the 1.0 release.</p>\n<h4>Simplified Starter Jar</h4>\n<p>Those upgrading to new modular JJWT versions from old single-jar versions will transparently obtain everything\nthey need in their Maven, Gradle or Android projects.</p>\n<p>JJWT's early releases had one and only one .jar: <code>jjwt.jar</code>.  Later releases moved to a modular design with 'api' and\n'impl' jars including 'plugin' jars for Jackson, GSON, org.json, etc.  Some users upgrading from the earlier single\njar to JJWT's later versions have been frustrated by being forced to learn how to configure the more modular .jars.</p>\n<p>This release re-introduces the <code>jjwt.jar</code> artifact again, but this time it is simply an empty .jar with Maven\nmetadata that will automatically transitively download the following into a project, retaining the old single-jar\nbehavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jjwt-api.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-impl.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-jackson.jar</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naturally, developers are still encouraged to configure the modular .jars as described in JJWT's documentation for\ngreater control and to enable their preferred JSON parser, but this stop-gap should help those unaware when upgrading.</p>\n<h4>JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Support!</h4>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/releases\">io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.12.1</h2>\n<p>This is a quick follow-up release from yesterday's <code>0.12.0</code> release that addresses a reflection issue on JDK 17.  The fix has been tested up through JDK 21.</p>\n<p>Notes are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.1/CHANGELOG.md\">CHANGELOG</a>, and project documentation is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.1/README.md\">README</a>.</p>\n<p>Please allow 30 minutes for the release to be available in Maven Central.</p>\n<h2>0.12.0</h2>\n<p>It is finally here!  This release includes full support for JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Keys (JWK), JSON Web Key Thumbprints, JSON Web Key Thumbprint URIs, and so, so much more.</p>\n<p>This is the culmination of <em>hundreds</em> of hours worth of work and testing, and we're glad to <em>finally</em> release it.  However, please note:</p>\n<p><strong>This is our first-ever breaking change release.</strong>  While we tried hard to minimize the breakages, some were just necessary in preparation for 1.0 and to finalize all JWT RFC features.  <strong>If you are not partial to fixing changes when upgrading a library, we strongly encourage you to wait until the 1.0 release.</strong></p>\n<p>Please pay particular attention to the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.0/CHANGELOG.md\">CHANGELOG</a> listing breaking changes.</p>\n<p>Full documentation is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.0/README.md\">README</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>0.12.1</h3>\n<p>Enabled reflective access on JDK 17+ to <code>java.io.ByteArrayInputStream</code> and <code>sun.security.util.KeyUtil</code> for\n<code>jjwt-impl.jar</code></p>\n<h3>0.12.0</h3>\n<p>This is a big release! JJWT now fully supports Encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWE), JSON Web Keys (JWK) and more!  See the\nsections below enumerating all new features as well as important notes on breaking changes or backwards-incompatible\nchanges made in preparation for the upcoming 1.0 release.</p>\n<p><strong>Because breaking changes are being introduced, it is strongly recommended to wait until the upcoming 1.0 release\nwhere you can address breaking changes one time only</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those that need immediate JWE encryption and JWK key support\nhowever will likely want to upgrade now and deal with the smaller subset of breaking changes in the 1.0 release.</p>\n<h4>Simplified Starter Jar</h4>\n<p>Those upgrading to new modular JJWT versions from old single-jar versions will transparently obtain everything\nthey need in their Maven, Gradle or Android projects.</p>\n<p>JJWT's early releases had one and only one .jar: <code>jjwt.jar</code>.  Later releases moved to a modular design with 'api' and\n'impl' jars including 'plugin' jars for Jackson, GSON, org.json, etc.  Some users upgrading from the earlier single\njar to JJWT's later versions have been frustrated by being forced to learn how to configure the more modular .jars.</p>\n<p>This release re-introduces the <code>jjwt.jar</code> artifact again, but this time it is simply an empty .jar with Maven\nmetadata that will automatically transitively download the following into a project, retaining the old single-jar\nbehavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jjwt-api.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-impl.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-jackson.jar</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naturally, developers are still encouraged to configure the modular .jars as described in JJWT's documentation for\ngreater control and to enable their preferred JSON parser, but this stop-gap should help those unaware when upgrading.</p>\n<h4>JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Support!</h4>\n<p>This has been a long-awaited feature for JJWT, years in the making, and it is quite extensive - so many encryption\nalgorithms and key management algorithms are defined by the JWA specification, and new API concepts had to be\nintroduced for all of them, as well as extensive testing with RFC-defined test vectors.  The wait is over!<br />\nAll JWA-defined encryption algorithms and key management algorithms are fully implemented and supported and\navailable immediately.  For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>AeadAlgorithm enc = Jwts.ENC.A256GCM;\nSecretKey key = enc.key().build();\nString compact = Jwts.builder().setSubject(&quot;Joe&quot;).encryptWith(key, enc).compact();\n<p>Jwe&lt;Claims&gt; jwe = Jwts.parser().decryptWith(key).build().parseEncryptedClaims(compact);\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

JJWT now fully supports Encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWE), JSON Web Keys (JWK) and more!  See the\nsections below enumerating all new features as well as important notes on breaking changes or backwards-incompatible\nchanges made in preparation for the upcoming 1.0 release.</p>\n<p><strong>Because breaking changes are being introduced, it is strongly recommended to wait until the upcoming 1.0 release\nwhere you can address breaking changes one time only</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those that need immediate JWE encryption and JWK key support\nhowever will likely want to upgrade now and deal with the smaller subset of breaking changes in the 1.0 release.</p>\n<h4>Simplified Starter Jar</h4>\n<p>Those upgrading to new modular JJWT versions from old single-jar versions will transparently obtain everything\nthey need in their Maven, Gradle or Android projects.</p>\n<p>JJWT's early releases had one and only one .jar: <code>jjwt.jar</code>.  Later releases moved to a modular design with 'api' and\n'impl' jars including 'plugin' jars for Jackson, GSON, org.json, etc.  Some users upgrading from the earlier single\njar to JJWT's later versions have been frustrated by being forced to learn how to configure the more modular .jars.</p>\n<p>This release re-introduces the <code>jjwt.jar</code> artifact again, but this time it is simply an empty .jar with Maven\nmetadata that will automatically transitively download the following into a project, retaining the old single-jar\nbehavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jjwt-api.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-impl.jar</code></li>\n<li><code>jjwt-jackson.jar</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naturally, developers are still encouraged to configure the modular .jars as described in JJWT's documentation for\ngreater control and to enable their preferred JSON parser, but this stop-gap should help those unaware when upgrading.</p>\n<h4>JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Support!</h4>\n<p>This has been a long-awaited feature for JJWT, years in the making, and it is quite extensive - so many encryption\nalgorithms and key management algorithms are defined by the JWA specification, and new API concepts had to be\nintroduced for all of them, as well as extensive testing with RFC-defined test vectors.  The wait is over!<br />\nAll JWA-defined encryption algorithms and key management algorithms are fully implemented and supported and\navailable immediately.  For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>AeadAlgorithm enc = Jwts.ENC.A256GCM;\nSecretKey key = enc.key().build();\nString compact = Jwts.builder().setSubject(&quot;Joe&quot;).encryptWith(key, enc).compact();\n<p>Jwe&lt;Claims&gt; jwe = Jwts.parser().decryptWith(key).build().parseEncryptedClaims(compact);\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Many other RSA and Elliptic Curve examples are in the full README documentation.</p>\n<h4>JSON Web Key (JWK) Support!</h4>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

NiFi integration revision\r\nAs we aim for a new release I bring a revision of the NiFi integration with a couple of improvements:\r\n\r\n* #900: this made the processors be able to auto-reconnect with small changes. And allowed to make:\r\n    * #593 : this was already done for the addresses. But the connection string had to be constant. Expression Language is now supported on the connection string.\r\n    * #629 : this was an old TODO. I have added validation for the connection string (if not EL in use) and to the addresses (if not EL in use in neither of them as we need the driver).\r\n\r\n* Add FilePropertyAccessStrategy: now we can read the addresses from a file in JSON format. Same as 'Address Text' property but in a file. Expression Language can be used and validation for the tags also works.\r\n*  Processors code revision: rewrote the onTrigger methods of the processors so they look more similar between them. To make them more maintainable.\r\n* Complete FlowFlile transfer: some FlowFiles did not transfer to failure correctly. Now the incoming FlowFile is sent to failure and one attribute is added with the localized message in case of any exception.\r\n* Timestamp field name: It was a fixed `ts` field/attribute we added. I have made a property that defines this field's name. \r\n* Update Readme to reflect changes.\r\n\r\nCloses #593\r\nCloses #629

the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803\">#3803</a>. Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.12.0 to 0.13.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.13.0</h2>\n<p><strong>These are release notes are identical to that of gopls@v0.13.0-pre.3. Thanks to all who tested the prerelease!</strong></p>\n<pre><code>go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@v0.13.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>This release fixes several bugs and mitigates a few performance regressions. It also somewhat reduces the latency and CPU cost of most operations, and includes a few small additional features.</p>\n<h1>Performance improvements</h1>\n<p>While <a href=\"mailto:gopls@v0.12.x\">gopls@v0.12.x</a> drastically reduced memory usage, several operations got around 50% slower due to additional I/O reading from the filesystem and time spent decoding indexes. This release optimizes those additional operations to (in most cases) achieve parity or better with the equivalent operation in gopls@v0.11.0.  Additionally, this release reduces total CPU while typing or performing common operations.</p>\n<h2>Faster code actions</h2>\n<p>This release includes a particularly large performance improvement in the evaluation of code actions (including formatting/goimports on save). In the past, there have been several reasons why this operation was expensive -- VS Code users may recognize the <code>getting code actions from &quot;Go&quot;</code> pop-up. This release fundamentally changes the way code actions are evaluated so that almost all of the work is pre-computed. As a result, formatting and adding or removing imports on save should be much faster.</p>\n<h2>Analysis performance</h2>\n<p>A notable exception to CPU performance parity with gopls@v0.11.0 is running static analysis. In this case, the additional cost incurred by <a href=\"mailto:gopls@v0.12.x\">gopls@v0.12.x</a> was not a regression, but rather the cost of analyzing many more packages to enable &quot;deep&quot; static analysis (see &quot;Improved static analysis&quot; in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.12.0\">gopls@v0.12.0 release notes</a>.</p>\n<p>In smaller repositories, the cost of this additional analysis is negligible -- analysis does not run until you stop typing, and typically just re-evaluates the changed package. However, it was discovered that in large workspaces that import low-level packages with a very large API surface (such as a cloud provider SDK or proto library), certain quadratic factors involved with the encoding/decoding of analysis results can dominate the cost of analysis, and result in enormous resource consumption: overloading the CPU and exhausting all memory.</p>\n<p>This release partially mitigates those quadratic factors, significantly reducing their cost and limiting concurrency so that they do not exhaust all resources. However, fully eliminating these factors will require additional work to fix their quadratic nature. Until that is done, analysis may continue to be costly on certain repos, especially if <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#staticcheck-bool\"><code>&quot;staticcheck&quot;</code></a> is enabled (because staticcheck does more deep analysis than the default set of analyzers).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, a notification is added to make you aware when analysis is slow, and provide an update on the progress of indexing &quot;deep&quot; analysis results. Canceling this notification will cancel the ongoing analysis, but it will resume after the next change. If you don't want to see these notifications, you can set the new <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#analysisprogressreporting-bool\"><code>&quot;analysisProgressReporting&quot;</code></a> setting to <code>&quot;false&quot;</code>.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/assets/57144380/4335a3c9-245b-409d-ab5c-5bbb650b7234\" alt=\"image\" />.</p>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<h2>Highlight deprecated symbols</h2>\n<p>Deprecated symbols and packages are now marked as such. To turn off this feature, disable the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/analyzers.md#deprecated\"><code>&quot;deprecated&quot;</code></a> analysis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/assets/57144380/f6714035-f37b-487a-a110-591388bb5677\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h2>Stub methods to fix missing method errors</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/analyzers.md#stubmethods\"><code>&quot;stubmethods&quot;</code></a> refactoring is now available as a quick-fix for errors related to missing methods.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/assets/57144380/715c3025-8beb-4cd5-bb8c-970be197b897\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h2>Improvements to function extraction</h2>\n<p>Function extraction now puts <code>context.Context</code> parameters first in the resulting extracted function. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/60738\">golang/go#60738</a> for details.</p>\n<h2>Improvements to the embeddirective analyzer</h2>\n<p>The embed directive analyzer now verifies the location of <code>//go:embed</code> directives, and provides a quick-fix to add missing <code>&quot;embed&quot;</code> imports.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/assets/57144380/acbe8599-3a2d-40cd-856e-3451ea03c939\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.11.1 to 0.12.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.12.0</h2>\n<p>This release contains a major rewrite of the way gopls computes and stores package information, with the goal of reducing memory usage and allowing gopls to scale to larger repositories. This change can also significantly reduce startup time when workspaces are reopened, as gopls now uses a file-based cache to persist data across sessions. With these optimizations, gopls is finally able to <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/48738\">fully analyze dependencies</a> using the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis\">golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis</a> framework, resulting in improved accuracy for analysis diagnostics.</p>\n<p>You can install this release with <code>go install</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@v0.12.0\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Support changes</h1>\n<p>As gopls matures, we're trying to simplify its configuration so that gopls Just Works in more scenarios, and so that we have fewer configuration combinations to test. This means that we will be gradually deprecating settings that affect the core behavior of gopls.</p>\n<h2>Removed experimental configuration options</h2>\n<p>As announced in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.10.0\">v0.10.0 release notes</a>, this release removes support for the <code>experimentalWorkspaceModule</code> and <code>experimentalWatchedFileDelay</code> settings. The <code>experimentalPackageCacheKey</code> setting is also removed, as it is irrelevant in the new design.</p>\n<p>The <code>experimentalWorkspaceModule</code> setting in particular may still be in use by some users. This setting has been superseded by built-in support for multi-module workspaces in the <code>go</code> command, via <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces\">Go workspaces</a>. To get the equivalent behavior in gopls@v0.12.0, please create a <code>go.work</code> file in your workspace using all desired modules. To use all modules in your workspace, run:</p>\n<pre><code>go work use -r .\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Dropped support for Go 1.13-1.15, deprecated support for Go 1.16-1.17</h2>\n<p>As announced in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.10.0\">v0.10.0 release notes</a>, this release drops support for Go 1.13-1.15, and in fact does not build with these Go versions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <code>gopls@v0.12.x</code> will be the final sequence of versions supporting Go 1.16-1.17, and therefore displays a deprecation notice when used with these Go versions.</p>\n<h2>Supported operating systems</h2>\n<p>Given that our users are almost entirely on Linux, Windows, or Darwin, we are discussing narrowing our support to focus on those operating systems, in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/59981\">golang/go#59981</a>.</p>\n<h1>Performance improvements</h1>\n<p>The banner feature of this release is an internal redesign that significantly improves the way gopls scales in larger codebases. Performance, particularly memory usage, has <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/36943\">long</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/37790\">been</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/43968\">a</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/44981\">pain</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/45363\">point</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/45457\">for</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/46897\">our</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/47855\">users</a>.</p>\n<h2>Reduced memory usage</h2>\n<p>Previous releases of gopls held typed syntax trees for all packages, in memory, all the time. With this release, these large data structures are ephemeral: as soon as they are constructed, an index of information derived from them is saved persistently to a file-based cache, and the data structures are recycled. The index for each package includes the locations of declaring and referring identifiers; the set of exported declarations and their types; the method sets of each interface; and any diagnostics and facts (see below) produced during analysis. The index holds all the information needed to serve global-scope LSP queries such as “references”, “implementations”, and so on.</p>\n<p>Moving package information to a file-based cache greatly reduces the amount of RAM gopls uses, by almost an order of magnitude in larger projects.

href=\"https://github.com/google/uuid/releases\">github.com/google/uuid's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Add randomness pool mode for V4 UUID and NullUUID for SQL Scanners.</h2>\n<p>From Andrey Pechkurov:</p>\n<p>Adds an optional randomness pool mode for Random (Version 4) UUID generation. The pool contains random bytes read from the random number generator on demand in batches. Enabling the pool may improve the UUID generation throughput significantly.</p>\n<p>Since the pool is stored on the Go heap, this feature may be a bad fit for security sensitive applications. That's why it's implemented as an opt-in feature.</p>\n<p>From Samuel Roth:</p>\n<p>Added support for NullUUID</p>\n<p>A NullUUID can be marked not valid (i.e., null) for use with JSON and the database/sql/driver.Scanner interfaces.</p>\n<h2>Add NewString()</h2>\n<p>This release introduces the NewString() function which is the equivalent of uuid.New().String().</p>\n<h2>Syntactic cleanup</h2>\n<p>There are no code changes.  A missing period was add to a godoc comment and the linter was told to not complain that the results of hash.Write() are ignored (the function cannot fail)</p>\n<h2>Further error optimizations</h2>\n<p>Do not allocate memory for errors (it is only one word)</p>\n<h2>Optimize error reporting</h2>\n<p>Optimize length of time it takes to discover an input is bad by no longer using fmt.Errorf, which is quite slow.  It now uses a custom error type that formats the string when the Error method is called rather than when generating the error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/uuid/commit/44b5fee7c49cf3bcdf723f106b36d56ef13ccc88\"><code>44b5fee</code></a> Minor cleanup.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/uuid/commit/e28eb7b914dd26e1a4e861df5e3226d0f2c256c5\"><code>e28eb7b</code></a> Remove TestConformance from null_test.go.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.11.0</h2>\n<p>This is a small release containing new integrations of vulnerability analysis.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability analysis for go.mod files can be enabled by configuring the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#vulncheck-enum\"><code>&quot;vulncheck&quot;</code></a> setting to <code>&quot;Imports&quot;</code>. For more information on vulnerability management, see the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/vuln\">Vulnerability Management for Go</a> blog post.</p>\n<h2>Support changes</h2>\n<p>This release removes support for the <code>&quot;experimentalUseInvalidMetadata&quot;</code> setting, as described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.10.0\">v0.10.0</a> release. Other settings slated for deprecation in that release remain temporarily supported, but will be removed in v0.12.0.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>Analyzing dependencies for vulnerabilities</h3>\n<p>This release offers two different options for detecting vulnerabilities in dependencies. Both are backed by the Go vulnerability database (<a href=\"https://vuln.go.dev\">https://vuln.go.dev</a>) and complement each other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports-based scanning, enabled by the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#vulncheck-enum\"><code>&quot;vulncheck&quot;: &quot;Imports&quot;</code></a> setting, reports vulnerabilities by scanning the set of packages imported in the workspace. This is fast, but may report more false positives.</li>\n<li>Integration of the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck\">golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck</a> command-line tool performs a more precise analysis based on-call graph reachability, with fewer false positives. Because it is slower to compute, it must be manually triggered by using &quot;Run govulncheck to verify&quot; code actions or the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#run-govulncheck\"><code>&quot;codelenses.run_govulncheck&quot;</code></a> code lens on <code>go.mod</code> files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4999471/206977512-a821107d-9ffb-4456-9b27-6a6a4f900ba6.mp4\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4999471/206977512-a821107d-9ffb-4456-9b27-6a6a4f900ba6.mp4</a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3>Additional checks for the <code>loopclosure</code> analyzer</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/analyzers.md#loopclosure\"><code>loopclosure</code></a> analyzer, which reports problematic references from a nested function to a variable of an enclosing loop, has been improved to catch more cases. In particular, it now reports when subtests <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Parallel\">run in parallel</a> with the loop, a mistake that often results in all but the final test case being skipped.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/206764370-7fc3c464-af04-4e4e-bb10-a6a0a89a99e3.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h2>Configuration changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#vulncheck-enum\"><code>&quot;vulncheck&quot;</code></a> setting controls vulnerability analysis based on the Go vulnerability database. If set to <code>&quot;Imports&quot;</code>, gopls will compute diagnostics related to vulnerabilities in dependencies, and will present them in go.mod files.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#run-govulncheck\"><code>&quot;codelenses.run_govulncheck&quot;</code></a> setting controls the presence of code lenses that run the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck\">govulncheck</a> command, which takes longer but produces more accurate vulnerability reporting based on call-graph reachability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<p>This version of gopls includes fixes to several bugs, notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>golang/go#57053</code></li>\n<li><code>golang/go#55837</code><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/56450\">golang/go#56450</a>).</li>\n<li><code>golang/go#54816</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full list of all issues fixed can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/293?closed=1\">gopls/v0.11.0</a> milestone.\nTo report a new problem, please file a new issue at <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/new\">https://go.dev/issues/new</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thank you to our contributors</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Arsen6331\"><code>@​Arsen6331</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/SN9NV\"><code>@​SN9NV</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/adonovan\"><code>@​adonovan</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bcmills\"><code>@​bcmills</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dle8\"><code>@​dle8</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hyangah\"><code>@​hyangah</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pjweinbgo\"><code>@​pjweinbgo</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/suzmue\"><code>@​suzmue</code></a></p>\n<h2>gopls/v0.10.1</h2>\n<p>This release contains a fix for <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/56505\">golang/go#56505</a>: a new crash during method completion on variables of type <code>*error</code>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
