KafkaServer startup() method instantiates a SocketServer, and then waits to call SocketServer enableRequestProcessing. In the intervening time, an exception may be thrown which prevents the enableRequestProcessing from ever being called, and the KafkaServer skips to calling SocketServer shutdown() instead.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the current SocketServer Acceptor and Processor implementations do not close their sockets. This causes the sockets to be leaked, potentially interfering with other tests. This change makes calling close() without first calling enableRequestProcessing perform the cleanup that the acceptor and processor threads would have performed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

are some places in the code where we create a `ConfigException` object by passing in a message String and an Exception. This is a standard pattern for exceptions, but it is incorrect for `ConfigException`, which interprets these arguments as a config key and config value. When we do this, the original exception is lost, since it is not interpreted as a `Throwable`, which can make debugging configuration errors difficult. This PR replaces such uses of `ConfigException` with `InvalidConfigurationException`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

patch adds the concept of a \"Full\" UpdateMetadataRequest, similar to what is used in LeaderAndIsr. A new tagged field is added to UpdateMetadataRequest at version 8 which allows the KRaft controller to indicate if a UMR contains all the metadata or not. Since UMR is implicitly treated as incremental by the ZK broker, we needed a way to detect topic deletions when the KRaft broker sends a metadata snapshot to the ZK broker. By sending a \"Full\" flag, the broker can now compare existing topic IDs to incoming topic IDs and calculate which topics should be removed from the MetadataCache. \r\n\r\nThis patch only removes deleted topics from the MetadataCache. Partition/log management was implemented in KAFKA-15605.","created_at":"2023-11-08T18:02:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T13:22:22Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T22:38:45Z","merged_at":"2023-11-16T22:38:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8622faf471da9291596d4dae1eb9044d07f2b8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5df309fcd79f600372f716f1e8aa679d1aeef792","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-15799-full-umr","ref":"KAFKA-15799-full-umr","sha":"5df309fcd79f600372f716f1e8aa679d1aeef792","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

\r\nWhen shutting down the network thread, we need to do the following:\r\n1. autocommit the current progress\r\n2. send a leave group heartbeat (KIP-848)\r\n3. Send out the pending request (for example, unsent commits) and complete them within the timebound\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a closing procedure to the `ConsumerNetworkThread`.  The actions can be summarized into the following:\r\n1. Make sure we have a reachable coordinator node, if not, try to discover one\r\n2. Once the node is discovered, prepare the requests (we need the node prior to sending because we need to know the destination)\r\n4. Continue to poll until either: 1. timer runs out of time or 2. all requests are completed.\r\n\r\nAfter the closingTasks are done: we then perform the last poll for the request managers, via the `pollOnClose` method, to send out the remaining requests.  For commit request manager, we need to send out the unsent commits and block until 1. timer runs out or 2. all requests are completed.\r\n\r\nThis is the original code I'm trying to implement:\r\n```\r\n try {\r\n            maybeAutoCommitOffsetsSync(timer);\r\n            while (pendingAsyncCommits.get() > 0 && timer.notExpired()) {\r\n                ensureCoordinatorReady(timer);\r\n                client.poll(timer);\r\n                invokeCompletedOffsetCommitCallbacks();\r\n            }\r\n        } finally {\r\n            super.close(timer);\r\n

a task is corrupted, uncorrupted tasks are committed. That is also true for standby tasks. Committing standby tasks actually means that they are checkpointed.\r\n\r\nWhen the state updater is enabled, standbys are owned by the state updater. The stream thread should not checkpoint them when handling corrupted tasks. That is not a big limitation since the state updater periodically checkpoints standbys anyway. Additionally, when handling corrupted tasks the important thing is to commit active running tasks to abort the transaction.

change fixes a broken abstraction where event execution relies on specific implementation detail of the ReplicaManager.appendRecords that with some arguments it is completed synchronously even though the interface is clearly asynchronous.  This assumption can be broken by changing implementation, as shown by KIP-890 work that added transaction verification stage that may result in asynchronous completion (which should be perfectly fine because the function interface is asynchronous and must be used as such) and violate the assumption of event execution.\r\n\r\nNow the event execution supports asynchronous completion and can properly handle asynchronous completion of the underlying functionality.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

What\r\nTestUtils.createTopicWithAdmin calls `waitForAllPartitionsMetadata` which waits for partition(s) to be present in each brokers' metadata cache. This is a sufficient check in ZK mode because the controller sends an LISR request before sending an UpdateMetadataRequest which means that the partition in the `ReplicaManager` will be updated before the metadata cache.\r\n\r\nIn KRaft mode, the metadata cache is updated first, so the check may return before partitions and other metadata listeners are fully initialized.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nInsert a `Thread.sleep(100)` in `BrokerMetadataPublisher.onMetadataUpdate` after \r\n```\r\n      // Publish the new metadata image to the metadata cache.\r\n      metadataCache.setImage(newImage)\r\n```\r\nand run `EdgeCaseRequestTest.testProduceRequestWithNullClientId` and the test will fail locally nearly deterministically.

discussion around [KIP-987](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-987%3A+Connect+Static+Assignments) has highlighted some strange behavior in the Connect runtime: if a connector's [taskConfigs method](https://kafka.apache.org/36/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Connector.html#taskConfigs(int)) returns more tasks than the value for its configuration's [tasks.max property](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#sourceconnectorconfigs_tasks.max), nothing happens (i.e., every task the connector generated a config for is brought up).\r\n\r\nIn [KAFKA-15575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15575), we discuss the possibility of taking action in this situation: failing the connector, only bringing up `tasks.max` tasks, and others. We may adopt one of these approaches in the future. For now, this warning message should at least get the ball rolling and decrease the likelihood of buggy connectors causing problems for Connect clusters that use static assignment (if/when that feature lands).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

applications that construct the various client configs multiple times, the config logging can be pretty extreme, so it's nice to be able to disable this for subsequent config objects that are created. We don't expose the constructors that accept a `doLog` parameter in the public API, but all the other clients at least make this constructor `protected` so it's possible to extend the class and suppress the excessive logging ([for example](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ed3fa83d385bbe2fa6dc4943660f56fec708bbc8/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerConfig.java#L690))\r\n\r\nHowever the ProducerConfig is the one case where this constructor is package-private. It would be nice to align it with the other client config classes and make this `protected` to allow turning off

PR covers a few important points:\r\n1. Exception handling: We should be thrown RetriableCommitException when the commit exception is retriable.  We should throw FencedIdException on commit and poll similar to the current implementation.  Other errors should be thrown as it is.\r\n2. Callback invocation: The callbacks need to be invoked on the main/application thread; however, the future is completed in the background thread.  To achieve this, I created an Invoker class with a queue, so that these callback can be invoked during the consumer.poll()\r\n\r\nNote: One change I made is to remove the DefaultOffsetCommit callback.  Since the callback is purely for logging, I think it is reasonable for us to move the logging to the background thread instead of relying on the application thread to trigger the logging.

current implementation of the reconciliation state machine on the server side is asymmetric when it comes to how it treats the revocation or the assignment of partitions. When partitions are revoked, the state machine cannot advanced until the consumer acknowledges the revocation. However, when partitions are assigned, the state machine does not wait on receiving an acknowledgement at all. This means that the next assignment can be delivered anytime.\r\n\r\nWhile working on the client side state machine, this asymmetric handling caused a lot of confusion and made the client side a lot more complex than we imagined. The complexity came from the need to buffer all the new assignments received while one assignment is being reconciled. Our goal is to simplify the consumer with the new protocol so this was going in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the server side state machine to always wait on a new assignment to be acknowledge before delivering a new assignment regardless from whether partitions are revoked, assigned or both.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

consumer refactoring project introduced another `Consumer` implementation, creating two different, coexisting implementations of the `Consumer` interface:\r\n\r\n* `KafkaConsumer` (AKA \"existing\", \"legacy\" consumer)\r\n* `PrototypeAsyncConsumer` (AKA \"new\", \"refactored\" consumer)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this task is to refactor the code via the delegation pattern so that we can keep a top-level `KafkaConsumer` but then delegate to another implementation under the covers. There will be two delegates at first:\r\n\r\n* `LegacyKafkaConsumer`\r\n* `AsyncKafkaConsumer`\r\n\r\n`LegacyKafkaConsumer` is essentially a renamed `KafkaConsumer`. That implementation handles the existing group protocol. `AsyncKafkaConsumer` is renamed from `PrototypeAsyncConsumer` and will implement the new consumer group protocol from KIP-848. Both of those implementations will live in the `internals` sub-package to discourage their use.\r\n\r\nThis task is part of the work to implement support for the new KIP-848 consumer group protocol.","created_at":"2023-10-30T20:17:01Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T20:10:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T13:00:40Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T13:00:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"22f7ffe5e1623d279096b45ab475768eeb05eee1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up the necessary prerequisites to respect configurations such as `dsl.default.store.type` and the `dsl.store.suppliers.class` (introduced in #14648) without requiring them to be passed in to `StreamBuilder#new(TopologyConfig)` (passing them only into `new KafkaStreams(...)`.\r\n\r\nIt essentially makes `StoreBuilder` an external-only API and internally it uses the `StoreFactory` equivalent. It replaces `KeyValueStoreMaterializer` with an implementation of `StoreFactory` that creates the store builder only after `configure()` is called (in a Future PR we will create the missing equivalents for all of the places where the same thing happens for window stores, such as in all the `*WindowKStreamImpl` classes)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThere is no change in functionality for this PR\r\n\r\n### Review Guide\r\n\r\n1. Start with looking at `StoreFactory` and read the JavaDocs, this is an interface representing what used to be `InternalTopologyBuilder.StateStoreFactory`\r\n2. Look at how `StoreBuilderWrapper` is what used to be the implementation of `InternalTopologyBuilder.StateStoreFactory`\r\n3. Note that `InternalTopologyBuilder#addStateStore` now takes in a `StoreFactory` instead of a `StoreBuilder` from everywhere that uses the DSL.\r\n4. The rest is piping that change around and wrapping `StoreBuilder` with `StoreBuilderWrapper`. In a future PR all `StoreBuilderWrappers` in the DSL will be replaced with a new one that respects the configurations passed in to `new KafkaStreams`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Statement:**\r\nWhen a new leader is elected for a __consumer_offset partition, the followers are notified to unload the state. However, only the former leader is aware of it. The remaining follower prints out the following error:\r\n`ERROR [GroupCoordinator id=1] Execution of UnloadCoordinator(tp=__consumer_offsets-1, epoch=0) failed due to This is not the correct coordinator.. (org.apache.kafka.coordinator.group.runtime.CoordinatorRuntime)`\r\nThe error is actually correct and expected when in the remaining follower case, however this could be misleading.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n1.  When scheduleInternalOperation is called, inside the lambda function that is executed at the event runtime, the existence of the context is checked. \r\n2. If the context doesn't exist, previously the exception would be thrown, now we just skip any operations and log an info message.\r\n\r\nTest was added to check the same, all other tests are still passing as expected.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-27T18:34:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T10:09:33Z","closed_at":"2023-10-31T10:09:32Z","merged_at":"2023-10-31T10:09:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"a48ca490e45b4af06c7cc60233f95702e347d248","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

In `UnifiedLog.truncateFullyAndStartAt`, local log start offset is not updated after truncating the local log to the new offset. This means that this offset is not updated when reconstructing the auxiliary state on a follower.\r\n\r\nIf this follower becomes the leader before the local log start offset has had a chance to be updated, reads from any offset between [wrong log start offset; actual log start offset] will be routed on the local storage, which does not contain the corresponding data. Consumer reads will in this case never be satisfied.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Update the local log start offset of a log after rebuilding the auxiliary state, and update corresponding unit test to verify this.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- Add an integration test to exercise the consumption of remote data on a leader that was previously a follower and had rebuilt its auxiliary state from remote storage.

the lack of a scheduled rebalance delay as opposed to a signal to immediately trigger a new rebalance), we immediately reassign all lost connectors and tasks.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded
