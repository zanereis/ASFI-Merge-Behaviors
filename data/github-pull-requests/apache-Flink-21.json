This also happens if avro isn't even used by the job, be it due to a mistake in the dependencies setup, branching or flink-avro being in lib. This forces users to always provide flink-avro going forward for affected jobs, because on recovery Flink complains if any of the Kryo serializers cant be loaded.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement `ParallelismProvider` for sources in the table planner to support setting parallelism for Table/SQL sources.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `CommonExecTableSourceScan` would get parallelism from `ParallelismProvider` if possible and configure the source parallelism into source transformation after validation\r\n- Introduce `SourceTransformationWrapper` to wrap the source transformation and expose a default parallelism to downstream\r\n- Use real source transformation when generate stream graph\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add end-to-end integration tests for setting source parallelism using table api\r\n- Add new field `@Nullable` parallelism in `TestValuesScanTableSourceWithoutProjectionPushDown` for the test related to ParallelismProvider in source\r\n- Test `SourceFunctionProvider`, `InputFormatProvider` and

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce SerializerConfig for serializers to decouple the serializer from ExecutionConfig.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIntroduce SerializerConfig and wire serializer-related methods in ExecutionConfig to it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests: ExecutionConfigTest & ExecutionConfigFromConfigurationTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) yes\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-18T05:25:01Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:25Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T01:54:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12a1505399fe586fc237fc94b578e1e93828730e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/584d157a1403f42b93381d13ce7c877cc84f409a","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-34090","ref":"FLINK-34090","sha":"584d157a1403f42b93381d13ce7c877cc84f409a","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-18T02:57:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T05:38:56Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea75d2e9916df0bcc6c178211a4dca36087a695b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/352762507edb48e1eb514c16d799a1b8afad4cf8","head":{"label":"ryanvickr:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"352762507edb48e1eb514c16d799a1b8afad4cf8","user":{"login":"ryanvickr","id":35666183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjY2MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35666183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":744799774,"node_id":"R_kgDOLGS-Hg","name":"flink","full_name":"ryanvickr/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryanvickr","id":35666183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjY2MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35666183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanvickr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr/flink","description":"Apache

accumulates data in `currentInputFiles` and only rolls them into `inputFiles` when `snapshotState()` gets called. At the same time it relies on separately receiving checkpoint indications from the upstream operator via `processElement()` (`EndCheckpoint`). If the job terminates, the final `EndCheckpoint` can arrive before the `snapshotState()` gets called. This leads to data loss (all events in `currentInputFiles` get discarded).","created_at":"2024-01-17T14:53:43Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:31Z","closed_at":"2024-01-24T09:07:56Z","merged_at":"2024-01-24T09:07:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d0f34e5a4a9127724bd09ecd0d9c0c0dba431f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bf24bf43889edd09e033afa66fef9219e34965ff","head":{"label":"afedulov:34111-compact-fix","ref":"34111-compact-fix","sha":"bf24bf43889edd09e033afa66fef9219e34965ff","user":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161525880,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1MjU4ODA=","name":"flink","full_name":"afedulov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCorrect the error message and doc of AdaptiveBatch only supports all edges being BLOCKING or HYBRID_FULL/HYBRID_SELECTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCorrect the error message and doc of AdaptiveBatch only supports all edges being BLOCKING or HYBRID_FULL/HYBRID_SELECTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T12:51:16Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:33Z","closed_at":"2024-02-01T08:01:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74789245feddbc08b21dc7a404061cb497a844f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/82cff49efde16882d78c05a3212901da4ad889c0","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-34132","ref":"FLINK-34132","sha":"82cff49efde16882d78c05a3212901da4ad889c0","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

pool\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for Values node*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for Values node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMore details see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34126\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCorrect the description of jobmanager.scheduler\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSince we have resolved some issues and marked as prodution-ready in [release note](https://flink.apache.org/2022/10/28/announcing-the-release-of-apache-flink-1.16/#generalized-incremental-checkpoint),\r\n\r\nwe could update some description about it in doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove some descriptions about experimental status*\r\n  - *Update some descriptions about benefits and limitations*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Move union restore tests to the right package*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nTests were already as part of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23653\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for Sort node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for Sort node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*1. Declare a new ArgumentHint to specify the name, type, and whether it is optional for an argument.\r\n*2. Support named parameters for functions.\r\n*3. Support named parameters for procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - ntroduce a new ArgumentHint annotation\r\n  - Support named parameters for functions \r\n  - Support named parameters for producers\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\ntest cases in FunctionITCase and ProcedureITCase to verify named parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented, will be added in a separator pr)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-16T18:34:45Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:43Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T12:18:39Z","merged_at":"2024-01-25T12:18:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb848dc0676d2c06adb3d16b3c6e51b378d4c57b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5f92624a3415921a7a00d8ad02641be67c9b752c","head":{"label":"hackergin:FLIP-387","ref":"FLIP-387","sha":"5f92624a3415921a7a00d8ad02641be67c9b752c","user":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":258399408,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTgzOTk0MDg=","name":"flink","full_name":"hackergin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnhance GlobalConfigurationTest.testInvalidStandardYamlFile to accommodate error message variations across JDK versions, ensuring test consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nEnhance GlobalConfigurationTest.testInvalidStandardYamlFile for JDK compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRunning GlobalConfigurationTest locally using JDK8, JDK11, JDK17 and JDK21.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-16T17:15:04Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T03:20:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fc5ee0daf038f20fe8be859f320965c512e922e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/57dba3db39c0f6072ec45ed2e158cbb85cec2ff8","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:fix_GlobalConfigurationTest.testInvalidStandardYamlFile","ref":"fix_GlobalConfigurationTest.testInvalidStandardYamlFile","sha":"57dba3db39c0f6072ec45ed2e158cbb85cec2ff8","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn order to raise cache hit ratio, we could enforce input of lookup join to shuffle by join key.\r\nIntroduce a hint to enable partitioned lookup join.\r\nAnd it primarily derived from this MR: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/18174/files, and adapted unit tests to the latest version.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Update `FlinkHints` and `FlinkHintStrategies` to introduce partitioned join hint*\r\n  - *Update related rule, to enforce hash distribution on input, including `BatchPhysicalLookupJoinRule` and `StreamPhysicalLookupJoinRule`*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n  - *Plan test in batch `LookupJoinTest` and stream LookupJoinTest*\r\n  - *IT test in batch `LookupJoinITCase` and stream `LookupJoinITCase` and `AsyncLookupJoinITCase`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement the changes to the Sink transformation which should depend only on the new API interfaces. The tests should remain the same, to ensure backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- SinkTransformationTranslator.java, CommitterOperatorFactory.java, SinkWriterOperator.java, StatefulSinkWriterStateHandler.java - to depend on the new API interfaces instead of the old ones\r\n- Idenpotent change in SinkV2TransformationTranslatorITCase.java - this left out during the test refactor\r\n- StreamGraphGeneratorTest.java, TestExpandingSinkWithMixin.java - Single specific test for the mixin interfaces\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded a single test method to the new API.\r\nKept all of the tests unchanged to make sure that the change is backward compatible.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request extends the exception message for sha2 function.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nmodify the function addReusableSha2MessageDigest.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-16T03:57:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"229b77d876c6075c57a9b821463dfc8071ed8271","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/871683417cee8f6d106e786a32c6a3035d3675f5","head":{"label":"xishuaidelin:flink-25054","ref":"flink-25054","sha":"871683417cee8f6d106e786a32c6a3035d3675f5","user":{"login":"xishuaidelin","id":39591515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTkxNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39591515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin","html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629308735,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYJ9Pw","name":"flink","full_name":"xishuaidelin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xishuaidelin","id":39591515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTkxNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39591515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin","html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd config options for administrator JVM options.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Added three config options: `env.java.default-opts.all`, `env.java.default-opts.jobmanager` `env.java.default-opts.taskmanager` that prepends to the corresponding non-default options.\r\n2. For non-YARN envs, directly assemble the JVM opts in shell command.\r\n3. For YARN env, change BootstrapTools#getTaskManagerShellCommand & YarnClusterDescriptor acccordingly. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- The non-YARN related change is tested by starting local standalone clusters & K8s clusters and manually verify the JVM opts.\r\n- The YARN-related change is covered by UT.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-15T17:08:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:50Z","closed_at":"2024-01-22T03:30:26Z","merged_at":"2024-01-22T03:30:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4eb8ac503f41fd793db1ac662fbedc46af92fd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/570180b439f11f9a125927eb027877ce74649a15","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-33221","ref":"FLINK-33221","sha":"570180b439f11f9a125927eb027877ce74649a15","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn issue FLINK-33490, the view name need to validate to check whether the name is conflict in new view. However, for syntax: `create view view1(a, b) as select t1.name, t2.name from t1 join t1 t2 on t1.score = t2.score; `. If user specify the column name, planner should not throw exception while creating view with specify field names even if the query conflicts in field names.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- support the syntax `create view view1(a, b) as select t1.name, t2.name from t1 join t1 t2 on t1.score = t2.score; ` not throw exception.\r\n- add test to cover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?  no docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-15T13:38:27Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:52Z","closed_at":"2024-01-19T03:16:25Z","merged_at":"2024-01-19T03:16:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"82fcdfe5634fb82d3ab4a183818d852119dc68a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5845195baf7d20fe05825ab2aa760a17ef420d84","head":{"label":"swuferhong:FLINK-33928","ref":"FLINK-33928","sha":"5845195baf7d20fe05825ab2aa760a17ef420d84","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-34087][tests][JUnit5 Migration] Migarate to junit5 of flink-dist module\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMigarate to junit5 of flink-dist module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBecause now FLINK shell scripts will read and modify the configuration file in flink-docker scenarios or when executing e2e tests, the transition from the default configuration file to a standard YAML file poses a challenge for command-line-based modifications. To support this behavior, we will extend the BashJavaUtils.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Support dump configuration object to nested standard yaml.\r\n2. Extend BashJavaUtils to support parsing and modifying standard yaml file.\r\n3. Introduce new shell script bash-java-utils.sh to include all BashJavaUtils command.\r\n4. Introduce new shell script config-parser-utils.sh to address the constraints of the DockerFile's RUN command, which cannot directly invoke a method within a shell script. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, for JobVertices without parallelism configured, the AdaptiveBatchScheduler dynamically infers the vertex parallelism based on the volume of input data. Specifically, for Source vertices, it uses the value of `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism` as the fixed parallelism. If this is not set by the user, the default value of 1  is used as the source parallelism, which is actually a temporary implementation solution.\r\n\r\nWe aim to support dynamic source parallelism inference for batch jobs\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Lazily initialize the parallelism of the OperatorCoordinator.*\r\n  - *Add the `DynamicParallelismInference` and `DynamicFilteringInfo` interfaces, and enable the `SourceCoordinator` to invoke corresponding methods for dynamic parallelism inference.*\r\n  - *The `AdaptiveBatchScheduler` applies dynamic source parallelism inference, and to avoid blocking the main thread by calling external systems, we have transformed the scheduling process to be asynchronous.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added integration tests to verify the end-to-end logic of dynamic parallelism inference, see `AdaptiveBatchSchedulerITCase#testSchedulingWithDynamicSourceParallelismInference` for details.*\r\n  - *Added unit tests for the newly added methods in classes such as `SourceCoordinator` and `AdaptiveBatchScheduler`.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the feature on a Flink session cluster (1 JobManager, 77 TaskManagers), including dynamic inference of parallelism, asynchronous scheduling, and execution exceptions in `DynamicParallelismInference`, all performing as expected.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nResolve memory leak issue of CEP operator caused by NFA State and SharedBuffer.eventsCount.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd flink-connector-hive in README\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add flink-connector-hive in README\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T14:56:35Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T13:23:58Z","closed_at":"2024-01-14T00:24:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d86779d1086cbb42d3f3f67e0dbbd123a6404e63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4147aacae70c6407f625c88ffdf1af0fdab4c4a6","head":{"label":"caicancai:hive","ref":"hive","sha":"4147aacae70c6407f625c88ffdf1af0fdab4c4a6","user":{"login":"caicancai","id":77189278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTg5Mjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77189278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai","html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":738115053,"node_id":"R_kgDOK_697Q","name":"flink","full_name":"caicancai/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caicancai","id":77189278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTg5Mjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77189278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai","html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, for JobVertices without parallelism configured, the AdaptiveBatchScheduler dynamically infers the vertex parallelism based on the volume of input data. Specifically, for Source vertices, it uses the value of `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism` as the fixed parallelism. If this is not set by the user, the default value of 1  is used as the source parallelism, which is actually a temporary implementation solution.\r\n\r\nWe aim to support dynamic source parallelism inference for batch jobs\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Lazily initialize the parallelism of the OperatorCoordinator.*\r\n  - *Add the `DynamicParallelismInference` and `DynamicFilteringInfo` interfaces, and enable the `SourceCoordinator` to invoke corresponding methods for dynamic parallelism inference.*\r\n  - *The `AdaptiveBatchScheduler` applies dynamic source parallelism inference, and to avoid blocking the main thread by calling external systems, we have transformed the scheduling process to be asynchronous.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added integration tests to verify the end-to-end logic of dynamic parallelism inference, see `AdaptiveBatchSchedulerITCase#testSchedulingWithDynamicSourceParallelismInference` for details.*\r\n  - *Added unit tests for the newly added methods in classes such as `SourceCoordinator` and `AdaptiveBatchScheduler`.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the feature on a Flink session cluster (1 JobManager, 77 TaskManagers), including dynamic inference of parallelism, asynchronous scheduling, and execution exceptions in `DynamicParallelismInference`, all performing as expected.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr is aims to update the query hint docs to clarify the resolution of conflicts in kv hint and list hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- update the query hint docs to clarify the resolution of conflicts in kv hint and list hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix LagFunction throw NPE when input argument are not null.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-31967.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is cherry-picked from https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24051\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Planning phase: Check whether the `emitUpdateWithRetract` method is implemented. If so, the `TableAggsHandleFunction#emitValue` method should invoke `TableAggregateFunction#emitUpdateWithRetract` instead of `TableAggregateFunction#emitValue`. Meanwhile, change the collector type to `RetractableCollector` and implement `RetractableCollector#retract`.\r\n\r\n- Runtime phase: Do not invoke emitValue to retract previously sent unchanged data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- `TableAggregateITCase#testFlagAggregateWithOrWithoutIncrementalUpdate`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T02:38:02Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:58:12Z","closed_at":"2024-01-14T05:10:22Z","merged_at":"2024-01-14T05:10:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7e9abe73a27edc2a27182b55307ff15d88f1042","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24074/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24074/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24074/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/970e31067f5a893ea90b3f8a33064051e597bfe3","head":{"label":"LadyForest:FLINK-31788-1.18","ref":"FLINK-31788-1.18","sha":"970e31067f5a893ea90b3f8a33064051e597bfe3","user":{"login":"LadyForest","id":55568005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY4MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55568005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest","html_url":"https://github.com/LadyForest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":209690029,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDk2OTAwMjk=","name":"flink","full_name":"LadyForest/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LadyForest","id":55568005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY4MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55568005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest","html_url":"https://github.com/LadyForest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LadyForest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LadyForest/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nset setAvoidFlushDuringShutdown to true for avoiding Flush when Cancel Task\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nset AvoidFlushDuringShutdown to true as default Rocksdb options\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yno)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery:  flink-statebackend-rocksdb\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T06:27:50Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:58:16Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T06:36:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d905427e67a9d6b59c8dadf7c9d22b30e4579011","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/556acc2a010b25284766bb9eeed2e18f2a8c2eef","head":{"label":"mayuehappy:FLINK-33946","ref":"FLINK-33946","sha":"556acc2a010b25284766bb9eeed2e18f2a8c2eef","user":{"login":"mayuehappy","id":13551348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy","html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":376075275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzYwNzUyNzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"mayuehappy/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mayuehappy","id":13551348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy","html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the implementation of the window aggregate op with new WINDOW TVF syntax is strongly bound to slicing windows such as TUMBLE, HOP and CUMULATE. This brings difficulties to the introduction of unslicing windows such as SESSION.\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to refactor some classes about window aggregate op to do the preparation for the introduction of unslicing windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *add two package 'groupwindow' and 'windowtvf' under 'org.apache.flink.table.runtime.operators.window' to split the different implements about the legacy group window agg and the new window tvf agg*\r\n  - *move the classes related into these two new packages*\r\n  - *extract abstract class about slicing window processor and operator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExistent tests can cover this changes.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T05:42:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:58:17Z","closed_at":"2024-01-22T02:15:23Z","merged_at":"2024-01-22T02:15:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"e345ffb453ac482d0250736b687cf88b85c606b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/571f65ad22e1ce21427f02ae9f17b26cf44c8c90","head":{"label":"xuyangzhong:FLINK-34049","ref":"FLINK-34049","sha":"571f65ad22e1ce21427f02ae9f17b26cf44c8c90","user":{"login":"xuyangzhong","id":25195874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk1ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25195874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyangzhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":401276291,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDEyNzYyOTE=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyangzhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyangzhong","id":25195874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk1ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25195874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyangzhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyangzhong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSavepointRestoreSettings#equals/hashCode/toString missed restoreMode property\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add restoreMode property for

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport fetching remote job JAR and additional artifacts (UDFs, formats, dependencies, etc.) in nativa Kubernetes and standalone application mode. The current change contains fetchers for DFS (via Flink FS abstraction) and HTTP. Builds on prior work from #20779 and addresses to comments on said PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* In standalone app mode, a `--jars` option is added, which has unlimited args, which will be fetched before the Flink cluster start. Example:\r\n```sh\r\n./bin/standalone-job.sh start-foreground \\\r\n  --jars local:///path/to/flink-sandbox.jar,local:///path/to/test-udf.jar \\\r\n  --job-classname org.apache.flink.DummyJob\r\n```\r\n* In native K8s app mode, the user can define additional artifacts via the `user.artifacts.artifact-list` property. Example:\r\n```sh\r\n./bin/flink run-application \\\r\n  --target kubernetes-application \\\r\n  -Dkubernetes.cluster-id=flink-cluster \\\r\n  -Dkubernetes.container.image.ref=flink:1.19-dev \\\r\n  -Duser.artifacts.raw-http-enabled=true \\\r\n  -Duser.artifacts.artifact-list=http://host.minikube.internal:9999/test-udf.jar \\\r\n  http://host.minikube.internal:9999/flink-sandbox.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Added tests for artifact fetching utils.\r\n* Added tests for artifact fetching logic.\r\n* Added tests to cover the changes in `DefaultPackagedProgramRetriever`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-27455][tests] Migrate SnapshotMigrationTestBase to JUnit5\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nMigrate SnapshotMigrationTestBase to JUnit5\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAzure Pipelines (see [pre-defined env variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)) and GitHub (see [pre-defined env variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)) use a different set of environment variables. The CI tools rely on some of the environment variables that are provided by Azure Pipelines. With the migration to GitHub Actions we need to make the scripts CI environment agnostic.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Made `tools/azure-pipelines/debug_files_utils.sh` use parameters instead of relying on environment variables\r\n* Made `tools/azure-pipelines/uploading_watchdog.sh` consider Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions environments\r\n* I checked for occurrences of the following substrings (based on [Azure Pipelines pre-defined env variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)) in the code to verify that we're not missing any other env variables:\r\n  * `$AGENT_`\r\n  * `$SYSTEM_`\r\n  * `$BUILD_`\r\n  * `$COMMON_`\r\n  * `$ENV_`\r\n  * `$CHECKS`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* PR CI should still work w/o errors\r\n* The [follow-up FLINK-33914 PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23970) should fail without the right environment variables being set in the fork XComp/flink's project being set\r\n* We should see a successful build with the necessary environment variables being set for FLINK-33914\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAsyncWaitOperator supports retry if retry Strategy is set. But there is no metrics to count the messages retried, message retry succeeded and dropped message count after reaching configured retry count. This pr has logic to add these metrics counter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - AsyncWaitOperator is updated to have metrics counter related to Retry flow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as AsyncWaitOperatorTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports implementing`emitUpdateWithRetract` for user-defined `TableAggregateFunction`, which is a missing feature since blink planner became the default planner.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- **Planning phase** Check whether the `emitUpdateWithRetract` method is implemented. If so, the `TableAggsHandleFunction#emitValue` method should invoke `TableAggregateFunction#emitUpdateWithRetract` instead of `TableAggregateFunction#emitValue`. Meanwhile, change the collector type to `RetractableCollector` and implement `RetractableCollector#retract`.\r\n\r\n- **Runtime phase** Do not invoke `emitValue` to retract previously sent unchanged data.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- `TableAggregateITCase#testFlagAggregateWithOrWithoutIncrementalUpdate`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no because it's a feature already mentioned in doc\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn several files there are some classes that are serializable but they do not contain any serialVersionUID field. The compiler generates one by default in such scenarios, but the generated id is dependent on compiler implementation and may cause unwanted problems during deserialization.\r\n\r\n## The Role of serialVersionUID:\r\n\r\nThe primary role of serialVersionUID is to provide version control during deserialization. When deserialize an object, the JVM checks whether the serialVersionUID of the serialized data matches the serialVersionUID of the class in the current classpath. If they match, the deserialization proceeds without issues. However, if they do not match, programmers encounter InvalidClassException.\r\n\r\nAs, serialVersionUID servers the purpose of version control of class during serialization-deserialization, without a serialVersionUID, we risk breaking backward compatibility when making changes to classes, which can lead to unexpected issues and errors during deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship and Support:\r\n\r\nThis work is done by the security researchers from OpenRefactory and is supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/): [Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/). Alpha-Omega is a project partnering with open source software project maintainers to systematically find new, as-yet-undiscovered vulnerabilities in open source code - and get them fixed – to improve

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSimilar to [FLINK-32023](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32023), a nagative value doesn't work for Duration Type like periodic-materialize.interval\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce periodic-materialize.enabled to enable/disable periodic materialization*\r\n  - *Replace all nagative cases about periodic-materialize.interval with periodic-materialize.enabled*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added StreamExecutionEnvironmentTest#testPeriodicMaterializeEnabled and StreamExecutionEnvironmentTest#testPeriodicMaterializeInterval*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes, but just introduce a new option whose default behavious is same like before\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for Correlate node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for Correlate node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the invalid configuration when using initialized root logger level on yarn deployment mode\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fill the containerized env values of root logger level before submiting  yarn application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 nodes cluster.\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a subtask of [FLIP-375](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/64lEE), which introduces the async-profiler for profiling Taskmanager. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Generalized file upload from TaskManager to support different `FileType` uploading (different `fileType` could have different `baseDir`)\r\n- Introduce APIs for Creating Profiling Instances / Downloading Profiling Results / Retrieving Profiling List on TaskManager\r\n- Provide a web page for profiling TaskManager on  Flink WEB\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded test that validates that `TaskManagerProfilingHandler` works fine.\r\nAdded test that validates that `TaskManagerProfilingListHandler` works fine.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no** \r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->","created_at":"2024-01-07T03:48:28Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T09:52:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T09:52:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cec097dd48a2e4522980706de6de318eebac1de2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a2ae9544d0afc7e99125c7d17f5253010a4c4541","head":{"label":"slankka:docs-verify","ref":"docs-verify","sha":"a2ae9544d0afc7e99125c7d17f5253010a4c4541","user":{"login":"slankka","id":8142133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8142133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka","html_url":"https://github.com/slankka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":370725064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzA3MjUwNjQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"slankka/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slankka","id":8142133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8142133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka","html_url":"https://github.com/slankka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slankka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slankka/flink","description":"Apache

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe current Protobuf format [implementation](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/c3e2d163a637dca5f49522721109161bd7ebb723/flink-formats/flink-protobuf/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/formats/protobuf/deserialize/ProtoToRowConverter.java) always sets ReadDefaultValues=True when using Proto3 version. This can cause severe performance degradation for large Protobuf schemas with OneOf fields as the entire generated code needs to be executed during deserialization even when certain fields are not present in the data to be deserialized and all the subsequent nested Fields can be skipped. Proto3 supports hasXXX() methods for checking field presence for non primitive types since Proto version [3.15](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.15.0). In the internal performance benchmarks in our company, we've seen almost 10x difference in performance for one of our real production usecase when allowing to set ReadDefaultValues=False with proto3 version. The exact difference in performance depends on the schema complexity and data payload but we should allow user to set readDefaultValue=False in general.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\n \r\nSet Default value for ReadDefaultValues=False for both proto3 and proto2 versions. Add documentation for users to set this value to true when using older protobuf versions before 3.15 and the performance implications. Additionally, We need to be careful to check for field presence only on non-primitive types if ReadDefaultValues is false and version used is Proto3. \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is a breaking change as older SQL queries without proper null checking can fail after this change. The row contents after deserialization will be different before and after this change. @libenchao will be making a note about this as part of the release notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *[FLINK-33817][flink-protobuf] update protobuf docs about readDefaultValues*\r\n  - *[FLINK-33817][flink-protobuf] Set ReadDefaultValues=False by default in Proto3 for performance improvement*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing unit tests and e2e tests for the Protobuf format for correctness. The performance improvement is benchmarked on testing clusters in my company.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? Both JavaDocs and flink docs are updated\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-06T00:06:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T18:14:18Z","closed_at":"2024-02-26T04:48:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac391b09d7ffc9674bfa7cffed16649feb1d10dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"snuyanzin","id":403174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/403174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/snuyanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"maosuhan","id":1617828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan","html_url":"https://github.com/maosuhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosuhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24035/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24035/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24035/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f4d21293152ca2b5335ddac82329f6be8407d162","head":{"label":"sharath1709:FLINK-33817","ref":"FLINK-33817","sha":"f4d21293152ca2b5335ddac82329f6be8407d162","user":{"login":"sharath1709","id":15180843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTgwODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15180843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709","html_url":"https://github.com/sharath1709","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":580950733,"node_id":"R_kgDOIqCazQ","name":"flink","full_name":"sharath1709/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sharath1709","id":15180843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTgwODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15180843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709","html_url":"https://github.com/sharath1709","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath1709/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public"

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, window aggregation doesn't support to consume a changelog stream, and will throw an exception.\r\n\r\nThis pr is introduced to support consuming cdc stream about window aggregate.\r\n\r\nSee more at [FLINK-20281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-20281) and [FLINK-27539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-27539)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Update the logic about inferring ModifyKind and UpdateKind for window agg node*\r\n  - *Introduce a count in window agg, and when there is no data in window, not output the agg result*\r\n  - *Add tests for TUMBLE, HOP and CUMULATE window tvf to consume cdc source*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTests are added for TUMBLE, HOP and CUMULATE window tvf to consume cdc source\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e.,
