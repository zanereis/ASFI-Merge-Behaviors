Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis commit shows how performance can be improved in expression language evaluation with a minimal set of changes to the code. The root evaluator stored in CompiledExpression instances is reused when creating queries instead of creating evaluators over and over again using the tree.\r\n\r\n#### Performance comparison\r\n\r\nWe ran a before/after test using a slightly changed version of the test case found in the expression language module and profiled it. We set the number of iteration to 1M to not take forever when the code is instrumented and we changed the expression to one where the effect is even clearer. The effect is noticeable with the original expression, too though. (75% less CPU time)\r\n\r\nHere is the test case with our changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void test10MIterations() {\r\n    final Map<String, String> attrs = new HashMap<>();\r\n    attrs.put(\"a\", \"world\");\r\n\r\n    final StandardPreparedQuery prepared = (StandardPreparedQuery) Query.prepare(\"${literal('world'):equals(${a})}\");\r\n    final long start = System.nanoTime();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\r\n        assertEquals(\"true\", prepared.evaluateExpressions(attrs, null));\r\n    }\r\n    final long nanos = System.nanoTime() - start;\r\n    System.out.println(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(nanos));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the performance when run on the latest master of nifi without my change:\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/483596/58564556-6e77e080-822d-11e9-8246-3bc501c110cb.png)\r\n\r\nThis is after applying my changes:\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/483596/58564573-78014880-822d-11e9-8b46-22fee37db11e.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see it takes about 40 seconds less with my changes. CPU time decreases by 85%. It gets rid of the most impactful call in every iteration: Query.fromTree()\r\n\r\nWe have a huge amount of expressions in our production flow that's why this issue is so noticable for us. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if my fix makes sense or if I'm missing something. I tried to keep it as simple as possible to demonstrate the issue in a clear way, so you might require some further changes to the structure to merge this.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

versioned flows\r\n\r\n@markap14 @ijokarumawak Everything in this PR appears to work in terms of saving to registry and importing, but I did want to ask what should happen when there are public ports with the same name in multiple process groups?\r\n\r\nFor example, I setup PG1 with public Input Port \"IN\" -> Update Attribute, and save it to registry. Then I created a GenerateFlowFile -> RPG connected to the \"IN\". Then I import a new PG and choose the same one I just saved to registry, so now I have two of the same PGs, both with an input port named \"IN\".\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though the RPG never recognized the second and continued sending to the original one. Then I renamed the second input port to \"IN2\" which showed as a local change on the PG, and I stopped the original input port. The RPG somehow refreshed and renamed the connection from \"IN\" to \"IN2\".\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T18:27:28Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T02:26:23Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T02:26:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7cd49d48b0d8fe6912705e2bf6c0642957566ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/a59eefaf82886dc628b2b79901cecfb527d43470","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-6315","ref":"NIFI-6315","sha":"a59eefaf82886dc628b2b79901cecfb527d43470","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to further fortify NiFi when working with large JSON files.  As noted in the [NiFi overview](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/overview.html), systems will invariably receive \"data that is too big, too small, too fast, too slow, corrupt, wrong, or in the wrong format.\"  In the case of \"too big\", NiFi (or any JVM) can continue just fine and handle large files with ease if it does so in a streaming fashion, but the current JSON processors use a DOM approach that is limited by available heap space.  This PR recommends the addition of a `SelectJson` processor that can be employed when large JSON files are expected or possible.\r\n\r\nThe current `EvaluateJsonPath` and `SplitJson` processors both leverage the [Jayway JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) library.  The Jayway implementation has excellent support for JSON Path expressions, but requires that the entire JSON file be loaded into memory.  It builds a document object model (DOM) before evaluating the targeted JSON Path.  This is already noted as a \"System Resource Consideration\" in the [documentation](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.9.1/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/SplitJson.java#L85) for the `SplitJson` processor, and the same is true for `EvaluateJsonPath`.\r\n\r\nThe proposed `SelectJson` processor uses an alternate library called [JsonSurfer](https://github.com/jsurfer/JsonSurfer) to evaluate a JSON Path without loading the whole document into memory all at once, similar to SAX implementations for XML processing. This allows for near-constant memory usage, independent of file size, as shown in the following test results:\r\n\r\n![SelectJsonMemory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693576/56772330-a059db00-6787-11e9-9cd2-08d201bfb7ab.png)\r\n\r\nThe trade-off is between heap space usage and JSON Path functionality.  The `SelectJson` processor supports almost all of JSON Path, with a few limitations mentioned in the `@CapabilityDescription`.  For full JSON Path support and/or multiple JSON Path expressions, `EvaluateJsonPath` and/or `SplitJson` processor should be used.  When memory conservation is important, the `SelectJson` processor should be used.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nThe [JsonSurfer](https://github.com/jsurfer/JsonSurfer) library is covered by the MIT License which is [compatible with Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a).  \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-on from #3414 in which I proposed a similar solution that required extenseive unit testing.  Tests from that PR were adapted and preserved for this PR, even though many of them are testing the `JsonSurf` library.  This is a much simpler PR since the path processing is handled in a third-party library.\r\n\r\nAs for the memory statistics noted above, they were gathered using the same methodology described in #3414.  For posterity, here's a python script to generate JSON files of arbitrary size:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport uuid\r\n\r\n(I, J, K) = (1, 8737, 3)\r\nwith open('out.json', 'w') as f:\r\n    f.write(\"[\")\r\n    for i in range(0,I):\r\n        f.write(\"[\")\r\n        for j in range(0,J):\r\n            f.write(\"[\")\r\n            for k in range(0,K):\r\n                f.write('\"' + str(uuid.uuid4()) + '\"');\r\n                if (k < K - 1):\r\n                    f.write(\",\")\r\n            f.write(\"],\\n\" if j < J - 1 else \"]\\n\")\r\n        f.write(\"],\\n\" if i < I - 1 else \"]\\n\")\r\n    f.write(\"]\\n\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to use SelectJson Processor\r\n\r\nGiven an incoming FlowFile and a valid JSON Path setting, `SelectJson` will send one or more FlowFiles to the `selected` relation, and the original FlowFile will be sent to the `original` relation.  If JSON Path did not match any object or array in the document, then the document will be passed to the `failure` relation.\r\n\r\n#### JSON Path Examples\r\n\r\nHere is a sample JSON file, followed by JSON Path expressions and the content of the FlowFiles that would be output from the `SplitLargeJson` processor.\r\n\r\nSample JSON:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Seattle\",\r\n    \"weather\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Snow\",\r\n        \"description\": \"light snow\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Washington, DC\",\r\n    \"weather\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Mist\",\r\n        \"description\": \"mist\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Fog\",\r\n        \"description\": \"fog\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[1].weather.*`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `{\"main\":\"Mist\",\"description\":\"mist\"}`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `{\"main\":\"Fog\",\"description\":\"fog\"}`\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[1].name`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `\"Washington, DC\"`\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[*]['weather'][*]['main']`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `\"Snow\"`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `\"Mist\"`\r\n    - FlowFile 2: `\"Fog\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Updated WriteAheadProvenanceRepository so that upon startup if provenance indexes are written using the old Lucene format, , they are considered 'defunct' and the events are re-indexed in a background thread into a new index that uses the Lucene 8 format and the old index is then removed. Added Provenance Repository that consists of about 30 events and added integration test to ensure that the repo can be started up/initialized when pointing to a prov repo that was written using the old lucene format.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Client pointing to a NiFi Registry instance and has components (controller service & processor) from a custom NAR (i.e. https://github.com/influxdata/nifi-influxdb-bundle) then stop NiFi, remove the custom NAR, stop the Registry, and then start NiFi and `tail -f logs/nifi-app.log` to look for stacktraces (they should be absent)._ \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache

PR should be merged after https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3416 to avoid merge conflicts due to regenerated certs in nifi-standard-processor.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing code, it is important to verify that server certs are not reused as client certs.  This PR updates several tests that reused server certs, but more investigation is needed for other areas of code that reuse them.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n- Specific components that use Jetty:  ListenHTTP, HandleHttpRequest, InvokeHTTP, JettyWebSocketClient, JettyWebSocketServer, TlsCertificateAuthorityService\r\n\r\nEach component should be tested in the following scenarios:\r\n- Verify an unsecured standalone instance of NiFi\r\n- Verify a secured anonymous standalone instance of NiFi\r\n- Verify a secured standalone instance of NiFi\r\n- Verify a secured cluster of NiFi\r\n\r\nTo test the TlsCertificateAuthorityService, certs for secured NiFi instances should be generated by a running NiFi CA service.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6196 for the list of issues encountered and their resolutions implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### **NOTE:** Please retain the flows used to verify this PR.  They can be reused for verifying functionality when NiFi supports builds on Java 11.\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a continuation of #3418 which I managed to somehow break.\r\n\r\n- This fixes deprecations in HBase 2.0 which will be removed in 3.0. Amongst other things the typeByte, sequenceId and tags are now considered internal and are not exposed anymore.\r\n\r\n- I also made it so that only either an hbase-site.xml or a ZooKeeper quorum need to be provided, previously ZooKeeper Client Port, Client retry and ZK Parent Node were mandatory as well but they are not really needed to connect to HBase\r\n\r\n- Removed the default for HBase client retries. This means it can still be overridden if needed but if not the defaults from either hbase-site.xml or HBase itself will be used\r\n\r\n- Some minor warnings (e.g. too broad scope, unchecked cast etc.)\r\n\r\n@bbende  Thank you for your time in discussing & reviewing the last one. I hope you have the time to look at this one as well (I'll update the Jira ticket as well)","created_at":"2019-04-09T22:21:48Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T21:02:48Z","closed_at":"2019-05-13T21:02:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6f86fc63d74a0c05a253fab8a10cc6697fef4a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/5dcd64f36f1bfa269c79a0fa79818f9eb09ebec2","head":{"label":"lfrancke:NIFI-6197","ref":"NIFI-6197","sha":"5dcd64f36f1bfa269c79a0fa79818f9eb09ebec2","user":{"login":"lfrancke","id":122850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjg1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke","html_url":"https://github.com/lfrancke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51437362,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQzNzM2Mg==","name":"nifi","full_name":"lfrancke/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lfrancke","id":122850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjg1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke","html_url":"https://github.com/lfrancke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lfrancke/nifi","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nThe current `SplitJson` processor works great when the targeted documents are small.  However, if a given flow needs to handle large JSON documents, the SplitJson processor can consume a lot of memory.  This is already noted as a \"System Resource Consideration\" in the [documentation](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.9.1/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/SplitJson.java#L85) for the `SplitJson` processor.\r\n\r\nI created a `SplitLargeJson` processor to address this concern. It uses an [event-based streaming API](https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/) to process the JSON without loading the whole document into memory, similar to SAX implementations for XML processing. This allows for near-constant memory usage, independent of file size, as shown in the following test results:\r\n\r\n![MemoryUsage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693576/55675222-4606e200-588d-11e9-84af-5c1abf326070.png)\r\n\r\nThe trade-off is between heap space usage and JSON Path functionality.  The `SplitLargeJson` processor supports a basic subset of JSON Path, excluding constructs that would require \"backtracking\" in the file.  See below for examples.  For full JSON Path support, the `SplitJson` processor should be used.  When memory conservation is important, the `SplitLargeJson` processor should be used. `SplitLargeJson` runs about 20 to 70 percent faster than `SplitJson` because it doesn't have to build a DOM before processing the JSON Path.  See the \"Test Methodology\" section, below.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nThe `SplitLargeJson` processor depends on `javax.json`, which is licensed under either GNU v2 or CDDL.  According to Apache legal docs, there is a [\"weak copyleft\" provision](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#weak-copyleft-licenses) allowing for compatibility between CDDL and ASF licensing.  Furthermore, Apache NiFi already includes `javax.json` in other modules:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ find . -type f | fgrep pom.xml | xargs fgrep -l javax.json\r\n./nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-site-to-site-reporting-bundle/nifi-site-to-site-reporting-task/pom.xml\r\n./nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-extension-utils/nifi-reporting-utils/pom.xml\r\n./nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-slack-bundle/nifi-slack-processors/pom.xml\r\n./nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-datadog-bundle/nifi-datadog-reporting-task/pom.xml\r\n./nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ambari-bundle/nifi-ambari-reporting-task/pom.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe LICENSE and NOTICE files were not changed with this PR since `javax.json` is already included.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR includes 30 new unit tests to verify the changes, primarily exercising different permutations of JSON Path expressions.  In addition, memory and timing metrics were gathered in order to confirm the trade-offs between `SplitJson` and `SplitLargeJson`.  See the memory usage chart above and the \"Test Methodology\" section, below.\r\n\r\n### How to use SplitLargeJson Processor\r\n\r\nGiven an incoming FlowFile and a valid JSON Path setting, `SplitLargeJson` will send one or more FlowFiles to the `split` relation, and the original FlowFile will be sent to the `original` relation.  If JSON Path did not match any object or array in the document, then the document will be passed to the `failure` relation.\r\n\r\n#### JSON Path Examples\r\n\r\nHere is a sample JSON file, followed by JSON Path expressions and the content of the FlowFiles that would be output from the `SplitLargeJson` processor.\r\n\r\nSample JSON:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Seattle\",\r\n    \"weather\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Snow\",\r\n        \"description\": \"light snow\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Washington, DC\",\r\n    \"weather\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Mist\",\r\n        \"description\": \"mist\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"main\": \"Fog\",\r\n        \"description\": \"fog\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[1].weather`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `{\"main\":\"Mist\",\"description\":\"mist\"}`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `{\"main\":\"Fog\",\"description\":\"fog\"}`\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[1].weather[0]`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `{\"main\":\"Mist\"}`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `{\"description\":\"mist\"}`\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[*].name`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `[\"Seattle\"]`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `[\"Washington, DC\"]`\r\n* JSON Path Expression: `$[*]['weather'][*]['main']`\r\n    - FlowFile 0: `{\"main\":\"Snow\"}`\r\n    - FlowFile 1: `{\"main\":\"Mist\"}`\r\n    - FlowFile 2: `{\"main\":\"Fog\"}`\r\n\r\nArray slices (`:`), recursive descent (`..`), and script expressions (`()`) are not supported.  However, a `fragment.index` attribute is set on every outgoing FlowFile to the `split` relation.  This, in combination with a `RouteOnAttribute` processor, can be used in place of JSON Path array slices.\r\n\r\n### Test Methodology\r\n\r\nMeasuring the memory usage of a NiFi processor can be tricky because these processors aren't meant to run in isolation.  They're designed to run in the NiFi JVM, of course, but in that context a processor will share heap space with all the other processors, controller services, and \"housekeeping\" infrastructure required to support the data flow.  This section describes how memory and timing metrics were obtained for evaluation of the `SplitLargeJson` processor.\r\n\r\nAn extensive testing framework exists for Apache NiFi that allows for processors to be exercised outside of a NiFi data flow.  The framework provides the ability to send FlowFiles to a processor and then assert the presence and content of FlowFiles generated by the processor.  This framework is built using JUnit and Maven, and can be invoked within an IDE or via command line interface (CLI).  Most Java IDEs are written in Java, and tests run from within the IDE share heap space with the IDE itself. Therefore, memory measurements were taken outside NiFi and outside an IDE, via CLI invocation of the NiFi testing framework.\r\n\r\nThe goal was to compare `SplitLargeJson` processor with the existing `SplitJson` processor.  To do this, NiFi was cloned, built locally, and instrumented to log its memory usage.  The following four lines were added at the end of the `onTrigger` method of `org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.SplitJson`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\r\n        rt.gc();\r\n        logger.info(String.format(\"Memory used: %.3f\",\r\n              (double)(rt.totalMemory() - rt.freeMemory())/(1024 * 1024)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point in the code, resources used to split the original FlowFile are still in scope.  A similar change was made to `SplitLargeJson`, to log memory before its `JsonParser` falls out of scope (after the the `while` loop yet inside the `try` block of the `onTrigger` method).  A simple test was then created that runs an arbitrary JSON file through the processor:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() throws Exception {\r\n        { // invoke static loading and \"prime the pumps\" by running a small file\r\n            TestRunner testRunner = TestRunners.newTestRunner(new SplitLargeJson());\r\n            testRunner.setProperty(SplitLargeJson.JSON_PATH_EXPRESSION, \"$.*[0][0][0]\");\r\n\r\n            testRunner.enqueue(Paths.get(\"/tmp/little.json\"));\r\n            testRunner.run();\r\n\r\n            testRunner.assertTransferCount(SplitLargeJson.REL_SPLIT, 3);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        TestRunner testRunner = TestRunners.newTestRunner(new SplitLargeJson());\r\n        testRunner.setProperty(SplitLargeJson.JSON_PATH_EXPRESSION, \"$.*[2][2][2]\");\r\n        testRunner.enqueue(Paths.get(System.getProperty(\"testFile\")));\r\n\r\n        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n        testRunner.run();\r\n        long stop  = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n\r\n        testRunner.getLogger().info(String.format(\"Process time: %.3f sec\", (double)(stop - start)/1000));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFive JSON files were generated using a python script, starting with 8 MiB and doubling until 128 MiB.  Each file was tested with each processor via CLI invocation of the NiFi testing framework, as mentioned above.  The resulting log output would then contain memory and timing information.  For example, this command runs a 32 MiB file through `SplitLargeJson` and shows the memory and timing results:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=gov.ic.cte.nifi.processors.PerformanceTest -DtestFile=/tmp/s32.json && \\\r\ntail -3 target/surefire-reports/gov.ic.cte.nifi.processors.PerformanceTest-output.txt | cut -c70-\r\n...\r\nargeJson - SplitLargeJson[id=5a60a1ab-912c-4d2a-aa4d-ce63badc8af0] Memory used: 34.382\r\nargeJson - SplitLargeJson[id=5a60a1ab-912c-4d2a-aa4d-ce63badc8af0] Split FlowFile[0,s32.json,33741503B] into 3 FlowFile(s)\r\nSplitLargeJson[id=5a60a1ab-912c-4d2a-aa4d-ce63badc8af0] Process time: 0.261 sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the corresponding test and output for `SplitJson`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PerformanceTest -DtestFile=/tmp/s32.json && \\\r\ntail -3 target/surefire-reports/org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PerformanceTest-output.txt | cut -c70-\r\n...\r\ntJson - SplitJson[id=33b08e70-c38e-4674-9b2d-0ffc087503f2] Split FlowFile[0,s32.json,33741503B] into 3 FlowFiles\r\ntJson - SplitJson[id=33b08e70-c38e-4674-9b2d-0ffc087503f2] Memory used: 164.947\r\nitJson[id=33b08e70-c38e-4674-9b2d-0ffc087503f2] Process time: 0.549 sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe attentive reader may notice that the above memory usage statistics don't match those presented in the graph from the \"Overview\" section.  This is because the raw output needs to be adjusted to account for the fact that FlowFiles are kept in memory while Apache's NiFi testing framework is running.  When these processors are running in an actual NiFi instance (under default configuration), the FlowFile content would be stored on disk.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that FlowFiles _provided to_ and _generated by_ processors in the testing framework are kept in memory (see the [importFrom method](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.4.0/nifi-mock/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/util/MockProcessSession.java#L431) and usage of the [transferMap](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.4.0/nifi-mock/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/util/MockProcessSession.java#L64) in MockProcessSession).  This is why a deep and specific JSON Path was selected for the tests: to reduce the size and count of the resulting FlowFile splits.  Otherwise, if a more inclusive JSON Path were to be used, the memory reading would need further correction to account for data generated by the processor in question.  The content of the three FlowFiles generated in these tests were only 41 bytes each.\r\n\r\nAs for the timing results, `SplitLargeJson` completed between 20 and 70 percent faster than `SplitJson`, for the same five generated JSON files:\r\n\r\n![Timing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693576/55675224-4c955980-588d-11e9-8956-4b3a4940a79e.png)\r\n\r\nThe timing metrics will vary based on the structure of the JSON document being split.  As an additional time test, a JSON file representing the City and County of [San Francisco's Subdivision parcels](https://github.com/zemirco/sf-city-lots-json) was split into fifteen thousand FlowFiles using both processors.  A perl script was used to create 5 different subsets from this file, at the same size increments as above (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128).  These tests had run times between 2 seconds and 5 minutes, and `SplitLargeJson` ranged between 20 and 50 percent faster.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
