Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8956\n### Description of the problem:\n\nPrior to version 4.2. Nicira/VmWare NSX used a variation of Open vSwitch as means of integrating SDN into hypervisor layer. Cloudstack NiciraNVP plugin was written to support OVS as a bridge to NSX.\nIn version 4.2 VMware introduced NSX vSwitch as a replacement for OVS in ESX hypervisors. It is a fork of distributed vSwitch leveraging one of the recent features of ESX called opaque networks. Because of that change the current version of NiciraNVP plugin doesn’t support versions of NSX-MH above 4.2 specifically in Vsphere environment. Proposed fix will analyze a version of NVP/NSX API and use proper support for ESX hypervisors.\n\nvSphere hypervisor mode operations when NV is deployed onto NSX managed network changes:\n- Current mode. A portgroup = UUID of CS VM NIC is created on a local standard switch of the Hypervisor where VM is starting. VM nic is attached to that port group.\n- New mode. No additional port group is created on a HW. No port group cleanup is needed after VM/NIC is destroyed. VM is attached to 1st port group having the following attributes:\n  *\\* opaqueNetworkId string \"br-int”\n  *\\* opaqueNetworkType string \"nsx.network\"\n\nIf portgroup with such attributes is not found a deployment should fail with exception.\n### VMware vSphere API version from 5.1 to 5.5:\n\nSince vSphere API version 5.5, [OpaqueNetworks](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.OpaqueNetwork.html) are introduced. \nIts description says: \n\n> This interface defines an opaque network, in the sense that the detail and configuration of the network is unknown to vShpere and is managed by a management plane outside of vSphere. However, the identifier and name of these networks is made available to vSphere so that host and virtual machine virtual ethernet device can connect to them.\n\nIn order to connect a vm's virtual ethernet device to the proper opaque network when deploying a vm into a NSX managed network, we first need to look for a particular opaque network on hosts. This opaque network's id has to be **\"br-int\"** and its type **\"nsx.network\"**.\n\nSince vSphere API version 5.5 [HostNetworkInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.host.NetworkInfo.html#opaqueNetwork) introduces a list of available opaque networks for each host. \nIf NSX API version >= 4.2 we look for a [OpaqueNetworkInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.host.OpaqueNetworkInfo.html) which satisfies:\n- opaqueNetworkId = \"br-int\"\n- opaqueNetworkType = \"nsx.netork\"\n\nIf that opaque network is found, then we need to attach vm's NIC to a virtual ethernet device which support this, so we use [VirtualEthernetCardOpaqueNetworkBackingInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.vm.device.VirtualEthernetCard.OpaqueNetworkBackingInfo.html) setting:\n- opaqueNetworkId = \"br-int\"\n- opaqueNetworkType =

I am not sure if the cmdline data will change on start stop. if the data dose change,  One way to fix this will be to send some data in the cmdline on reboot to say that we can use the existing data in the cmdline(not need to wait or loop).

clustered management server environment\n\nThis pull request relates to the following Jira bug report:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8937\n\nThis has been tested by checking out the tagged 4.5.2 release, making the changes detailed, compiling and then copying the webapps/client/WEB-INF/lib/cloud-plugin-hypervisor-xenserver-4.5.2.jar file into a 4.5.2 cluster of 4 management servers. The cluster is running two xenserver pods, the hosts of which are running Xenserver 6.5. \n\nLive migrations have then been tested with vm's which have single and multiple disks on local storage. Tests have only been performed on live migrations within the same pod. \n\nPrior to this fix, migrations would intermittently fail (details in the above jira link). With this fix in place, no further issues have been seen.

regarding usage event emission. \n\nUsageEventUtils was previously not checking deleted accounts, which meant that if an account was deleted that had some resources running on it, those resources would get destroyed without emitting any events. \n\nFurthermore, the VOLUME_DELETE event of ROOT volumes is the responsibility of the UserVmManager, which gets circumvented when expunging resources following the account deletion. Added a check to the AccountManager which catches the ROOT volumes that need to be deleted and emits events for them. \n\nTo test this: Create a new user. As that user, create and destroy an instance. This should cause the VM_CREATE, VM_START, VM_STOP, VM_DESTROY, VOLUME_CREATE, and VOLUME_DELETE events to be emitted. \nCreate a new instance as the same user. Log in as admin, and delete the user. The same set of events should be emitted, and there should be no duplicate DELETE events for the ROOT volume of the previous instance.

restart network was failing when using external loadbalencer. The failure was because of a number format exception. When BroadcastDomainType.getValue(guestConfig.getBroadcastUri() is executed this returns a string untagged. We were trying to parse this as long so there was a number pointer exception.\n\nThis happens only when the vlan uri is vlan://untagged. in other cases were there is a number instead of untagged (vlan tag) this used to succeed. Although we were trying to convert the number to long we were not really using it. we were converting the number to long and then back to string when creating the IpAddressTo. so I removed this unnecessary conversion in this case for fixing the issue at hand.\n\nI did a manual restart of the network and checked for this number format exception in a EIP/ELB setup.\n","created_at":"2015-09-29T05:08:10Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T10:38:47Z","closed_at":"2015-11-04T10:38:47Z","merged_at":"2015-11-04T10:38:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bf54c2b0a0120a7f9951237a67f4cb1f4efc7f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/3c61746dcec5025d10fda0f85c9157f69f58b15d","head":{"label":"bvbharatk:CLOUDSTACK-8902","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-8902","sha":"3c61746dcec5025d10fda0f85c9157f69f58b15d","user":{"login":"bvbharatk","id":2075740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzU3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2075740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk","html_url":"https://github.com/bvbharatk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40658353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY1ODM1Mw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"bvbharatk/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bvbharatk","id":2075740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzU3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2075740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk","html_url":"https://github.com/bvbharatk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bvbharatk/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

This happens because the hosts that reach the max guest limit were not getting added to the avoid list and hence the cluster. \n\nVerified the fix on my local setup.\n\nRepro Steps:\n1. Take an environment with single cluster and 2 hosts.\n2. change the max guest limit for the hypervisor such that on one host max guest limit should reach.\n3. change thresholds so that other host should not have enough storage. If required create a VM for sufficient bigger disk.\n4.

a vmware host failure\n\nIn case of vmware host failure, all the VMs including stopped VMs migrate to the new host. For the Stopped Vms powerhost gets updated. This was triggering HandlePowerStateReport which finally calls updatePowerState updating update_time for the VM. This cause the capacity being reserved for stopped VMs capacity skip counting hours. \n\nAdded the change to avoid update if the VM is in stopped state and host Id is null. \n\nVerified the fix manually. \n\nHere are the repro steps:\n1. take a HA enabled cluster with two hosts.\n2. should have few started and stopped VMs to each of the host.\n3.

I worked with @wilderrodrigues to figure out what is wrong with the virtual router. As we couldn't test single PRs any more (because of other issues with them causing tests to fail) we added all VR related PRs in a separate branch and started testing from there.\n\nWe combined the following PRs into this PR:\n#836 #851 #867 #870 #881 #882 #842\n\nAfter that, one issue remains: the VPC does not get a default gateway. Which is strange, because we already solved it in PR #738. When I look back, it was fixed again in PR #784. It could very well be that either one fixed one specific case, but also breaking the other. We need to investigate this, and make sure there will be a fix that works both for VPCs and VRs.\n\nWhen we manually add the default gateway on the VPC, most tests pass and also spinning up two VPCs with one tier each, having a VM and them using s2s to VPN them together works fine. See for more details the report Wilder sent earlier.\n\nTomorrow we'll try to figure out how to fix the default gateway and merge this. Then we should have a base to work from again. Any PR that fixes another blocker, should at least then be rebased against the fixed master so we can run the tests against the PR branch. I'm not saying everything is fixed, I'm just saying that we can spin up a cloud that has working VMs.\n\nWhen, in the mean time, someone has the time to checkout this branch and make the default route work for both VPC and VR that would be awesome. After that we should double check and verify the test results. \n\nPinging @karuturi to let her know the current status.\n\nRegards,\nWilder /

issue occurs when a volume in Ready state is moved across storage\npools.\n\nWhile finding if the storage pool has enough space, it has a check to\nconsider the size of non Ready volumes only. This is true if the volume\nto be attached to a vm is in the same storage pool. But, if the volume\nis in another storage pool and has to be moved to a vm's storage pool,\nthe size of the volume should be considered in doing the space check.\n\ncomputing the asking size when volume is not in ready state or when the \nvolume is on a different storage pool.\n\nTesting:\nI couldnt write unittests for it. This class is not in a unittestable state.\n\nmanually tested in the below environment\n1. xenserver 6.5 setup with 2 clusters and a host each in each of them.\n2. added storage tags for the primary storage.\n3. created two service offerings with the storage tags.\n4. deployed two vms using newly created offerings in step 3.\n5. at this stage, there are two vms one on each host with root disks on the corresponding primary.\n6. create a data disk and attach it to vm1\n7. detach the data disk. now the data disk is in the primary storage of the cluster of vm1 (let us say primary1)\n8. attach this data disk to vm2(running on a host in different cluster)\n9. the volume should be moved to the primary storage of another cluster and op_host_capacity should be accordingly updated.\n","created_at":"2015-09-22T09:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T09:16:16Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T09:16:16Z","merged_at":"2017-02-14T09:16:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"bec9115a617ecac27e5b5785c8e838a535764f7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/873/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/873/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/873/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bec9115a617ecac27e5b5785c8e838a535764f7d","head":{"label":"karuturi:CLOUDSTACK-8896","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-8896","sha":"bec9115a617ecac27e5b5785c8e838a535764f7d","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39767553,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTc2NzU1Mw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"karuturi/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

Tried dynamic scaling with offering which has K180Q defined.\nObservation: \n1. Currently vGPU resource dynamic scaling is not supported. But CloudStack returns success and updating the VM details with new offering details including new vGPU type. \n2. But from Xenserver , There is no change with vGPU type and it remains with old vGPU type. This is not correct\nExpected Result:\nDynamic scaling should be restricted when source/destination offering has vGPU type on a vGPU enabled

by implementing Callable you switched a couple of methods and fields. I switched them some more!\n\nThe reason why the Agent wouldn't reconnect was due to two facts.\n\nProblem 1: Selector was blocking.\nIn the while loop at [1] _selector.select(); was blocking when the connection was lost. This means at [2] _isStartup = false; was never excecuted. Therefore at [3] the call to isStartup() always returned true resulting in an infinite loop.\n\nResolution 1: Move the call to cleanUp() [4] before checking if isStartup() has turned to false. cleanUp() will close() the _selector resulting in _isStartup to be set to false.\n\nProblem 2: Setting _isStartup & _isRunning to true when init() throwed an unchecked exception (ConnectException).\nThe exception was nicely caught, but only logged. No action was taken! Resulting in _isStartup & _isRunning being set to true. Resulting in the fact the Agent thought it was connected successfully, though it wasn't.\n\nResolution 2: Adding return to the catch statement [5]. This way _isStartup & _isRunning aren't set to true.\n\nSteps to test:\n1. Deploy ACS.\n2. Try all combinations of stopping/starting managment

Support multiple physical networks at cluster level for guest traffic over VMware deployments. Changes done =>\r\n\r\n1. API Changes: \r\n- addCluster and updateCluster - new optional parameter physicalnetworktrafficlabels added\r\n- listClusters - new optional parameter showtrafficlabelinfo to show the cluster override traffic details. This is required to support the GUI.\r\n\r\n2. VMware resource changes\r\n3. Database and Upgrade changes\r\n4. UI changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, in cloudstack, the support for cluster level override settings (introduced in 4.2.0 with VMware DVS Integration) for guest and public traffic types blocks support for multiple physical networks defined in the zone for these traffic types over VMware deployments. It is required to support multiple physical networks defined in the zone for these traffic types at zone and cluster level(when defined) without impacting existing cluster level override settings. This would also fix the issue CLOUDSTACK-7151 - vmware: Type of vSwitch was not detected correctly while preparing public/guest virtual networks.\r\n\r\nAlso, renaming of vSwitch name for guest and public traffic type overridden at cluster in current cloudstack deployment has become troublesome, requiring manual update to database. This need to be addressed such that admin would be able to seamlessly re-name vSwitch name at cluster in Cloudstack whenever required, even in production cloud.\r\n\r\nDesign change for existing cluster level traffic override settings.
