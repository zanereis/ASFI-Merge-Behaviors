Consolidate the task recycle procedure into a single function within the task. The current procedure now becomes: a) task.recycleStateAndConvert, at end of it the task is in `closed` while its stateManager is retained, and the manager type has been converted; 2) create the new task with old task's fields and the stateManager inside the creators.\r\n2. Move the task execution related metadata into the corresponding `TaskExecutionMetadata` class, including the task idle related metadata (e.g. successfully processed tasks); reduce the number of params needed for `TaskExecutor` as well as `Tasks`.\r\n3. Move the task execution related fields (embedded producer and consumer) and task creators out of `Tasks` and migrated into `TaskManager`. Now the `Tasks` is only a bookkeeping place without any task mutation logic.\r\n4. When adding tests, I realized that we should not add task to state updater right after creation, since it was not initialized yet, while state updater would validate that the task's state is already `restoring / running`. So I updated that logic while adding unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

copied from [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14093):\r\n\r\nThe Javadoc for the `testFencedLeaderRecovery` test case calls out that it uses a one-node cluster, and the [check we do](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/679e9e0cee67e7d3d2ece204a421ea7da31d73e9/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/integration/ExactlyOnceSourceIntegrationTest.java#L493-L494) to make sure that the leader is up and running (and has had a chance to instantiate its transactional producer for the config topic) relies on that fact. However, we don't reduce the cluster size to one in the test, so right now it's running with the default of three workers.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it's possible that the readiness check we're doing hits a follower worker and passes before the leader has had a chance to finish startup.\r\n\r\nThese changes fix that issue by ensuring that the test runs with only a single worker. In addition, the transactional producers brought up for testing are given meaningful client IDs so that they can be easily distinguished from the producers brought up by the embedded Connect

Description\r\nIn this test, when third proc join, sometimes there are other rebalance scenarios such as followup joingroup request happens before syncgroup response was received by one of the proc and the previously assigned tasks for that proc is then lost during new joingroup request. This can result in standby tasks assigned as `3, 1, 2`. This PR relax the expected assignment of `2, 2, 2` to a range of `[1-3]`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRan existing test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n\r\n### Some backgroud from Guozhang:\r\nI talked to Hao Li offline and also inspected the code a bit, and tl;dr is that I think the code logic is correct (i.e. we do not really have a bug), but we need to relax the test verification a little bit. The general idea behind the subscription info is that:\r\n\r\n* When a client joins the group, its subscription will try to encode all its current assigned active and standby tasks, which would be used as prev active and standby tasks by the assignor in order to achieve some stickiness.\r\n\r\n* When a client drops all its active/standby tasks due to errors, it does not actually report all empty from its subscription, instead it tries to check its local state directory (you can see that from `TaskManager#getTaskOffsetSums` which populates the `taskOffsetSum`. For active task, its offset would be “-2” a.k.a. `LATEST_OFFSET`, for standby task, its offset is an actual numerical number.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo in this case, the proc2 which drops all its active and standby tasks, would still report all tasks that have some local state still, and since it was previously owning all six tasks (three as active, and three as standby), it would report all six as standbys, and when that happens the resulted assignment as @Hao Li verified, is indeed the un-even one.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo I think the actual “issue“ happens here, is when proc2 is a bit late sending the sync-group request, when the previous rebalance has already completed, and a follow-up rebalance has already triggered, in that case, the resulted un-even assignment is indeed expected. Such a scenario, though not common, is still legitimate since in practice all kinds of timing skewness across instances can happen. So I think we should just relax our verification here, i.e. just making sure that each instance has at least one standby replica at the end, not exactly evenly as “2, 2,

Fix issue where responses intermittently takes 300+ ms to respond, even when the server is idle.\r\n\r\nProcessing request got delayed by 300 ms in the following condition:\r\n1. Client-Server communication uses SSL socket\r\n2. More than one requests are in the same network packet\r\n\r\nThis 300 ms delay occurs because the socket has no data but the buffer has data. And the sequence of events that leads to this situation is the following (high level):\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Client sends more than one requests in the same network packet.\r\nStep 2 - Server processes the 1st request. While doing this, SslTransportLayer reads all of the bytes (containing multiple requests) from the socket and stores it in the buffer.\r\nStep 3 - Server sends the response for the 1st request.\r\nStep 4 - Server processes the 2nd request. This request is taken from the SslTransportLayer buffer, instead of the socket. Because of this, \"select(timeout)\" blocks for 300 ms. THIS IS WHERE THE DELAY IS.\r\n\r\nFrom producer side, this happens when you produce continuous records in a tight loop and then suddenly stop for more than 300 ms.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, Selector set \"madeReadProgressLastPoll\" to \"true\" after unmuting the channel, if there's data in the buffer.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

The default Scala Zinc version was updated from 1.3.5 to 1.6.1\r\n* Multiple Checkstyle tasks may now run in parallel within a project\r\n* Support for Java 18\r\n* Much more responsive continuous builds on Windows and macOS\r\n* Improved diagnostics for dependency resolution\r\n\r\nSome of our tests require java.util and java.lang modules to be open,\r\nso do it explicitly given the following Gradle bug fix:\r\n\r\n> When running on Java 9+, Gradle no longer opens the java.base/java.util\r\n> and java.base/java.lang JDK modules for all Test tasks. In some cases,\r\n> this would cause code to pass during testing but fail at runtime.\r\n\r\nRelease notes: https://docs.gradle.org/7.5/release-notes.html\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

notes:\r\n\r\n1. Introduced new `ConcurrencyUtils` and `MockitoUtils` classes for reusable testing logic that will likely be used in the near future for [KAFKA-14059](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14059) and [KAFKA-14060](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14060).\r\n2. Refactored a lot of common logic into dedicated methods, which reduces test size and should make tests easier to write.\r\n3. Doubled the default record batch size from 1 to 2. This provides better coverage and, after all the refactoring from step 2, required no modifications to mocking, verification, or assertion logic anywhere in the test suite.\r\n4. Stopped inheriting from the `ThreadedTest` class as it does nothing (filed https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12410 to apply this change across the board).\r\n5. Once this looks good enough to merge, I'll begin applying the same changes to the `WorkerSourceTaskTest` and possibly `AbstractWorkerSourceTaskTest` test suites.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T23:26:15Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T16:42:12Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T16:42:08Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T16:42:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"14c36c7539cf5a7a54c2c7e30e115b3f4c4a9402","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/13a00442998c20e990db2b0a6fe3088477101fb6","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-14058","ref":"kafka-14058","sha":"13a00442998c20e990db2b0a6fe3088477101fb6","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

ControllerApis, we are making use of the CompletableFuture-s returned by QuorumController to add callbacks via `whenComplete`. Since these chained methods on CompletableFuture return a _new_ CompletableFuture instance, the ControllerPurgatory does not capture any of downstream exceptions when completing the original instance. The only way to see these errors is to call `get` on the chained future, or to add additional completion stages to handle the error explicitly. However, we do not want to call `get` since that would block the request threads.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the signature of the request handlers in ControllerApis to all return CompletableFuture. It also converts all of the `CompletableFuture#whenComplete` callbacks to `CompletableFuture#handle`. This allows us to directly handle exceptions thrown by the controller in the individual request handlers. A single `whenComplete` error handler is added in `ControllerApis#handle` which will ensure we log exceptions thrown by the response builders (or other logic in the chained `handle` calls). \r\n\r\nThe resulting future chain now looks like:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncontroller.doStuff()\r\n    .handle { (result, exception) => \r\n      // Transform result or exception into a response \r\n    }\r\n    .whenComplete { (result, exception) => \r\n      // Handle errors thrown in \"handle\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe future is still completed by ControllerPurgatory, and that is when the completion stages are run. We do not call `get` in ControllerApis to avoid blocking the request threads.\r\n\r\nThere is some opportunity for cleanup and consolidation of error handling in ControllerApis, but I'd rather make a separate PR for that.","created_at":"2022-07-13T18:44:04Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T23:08:59Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T23:08:59Z","merged_at":"2022-07-26T23:08:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"14d2269471141067dc3c45300187f20a0a051777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b3f2baf0791be2e1d969fb31401f35ea1ffa4ca0","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-13166-controller-apis-exceptions","ref":"KAFKA-13166-controller-apis-exceptions","sha":"b3f2baf0791be2e1d969fb31401f35ea1ffa4ca0","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

parsing code receives a payload for a variable length field where the length is specified in the code as some arbitrarily large number (assume INT32_MAX for example) this will immediately try to allocate an ArrayList to hold this many elements, before checking whether this is a reasonable array size given the available data. \r\n\r\nThe fix for this is to instead throw a runtime exception if the length of a variably sized container exceeds the amount of remaining data. Then, the worst a user can do is force the server to allocate 8x the size of the actual delivered data (if they claim there are N elements for a container of Objects (i.e. not a byte string) and each Object bottoms out in an 8 byte pointer in the ArrayList's backing array).\r\n\r\nThis was identified by fuzzing the kafka request parsing code.","created_at":"2022-07-10T00:04:54Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T05:46:00Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T05:46:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be025dfa7305078d67c41979738fe5774254bac6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/38c902c657fd57d2280abd67556ef74a60fa6f5d","head":{"label":"dpcollins-google:fix-KAFKA-14063","ref":"fix-KAFKA-14063","sha":"38c902c657fd57d2280abd67556ef74a60fa6f5d","user":{"login":"dpcollins-google","id":40498610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDk4NjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40498610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google","html_url":"https://github.com/dpcollins-google","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":512306614,"node_id":"R_kgDOHokttg","name":"kafka","full_name":"dpcollins-google/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dpcollins-google","id":40498610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDk4NjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40498610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google","html_url":"https://github.com/dpcollins-google","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpcollins-google/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dpcollins-google/kafka","description":"Mirror

by @emissionnebula\r\n\r\nWhat\r\n----\r\nKafka client is adding and removing the SASL extensions alternatively at the time of token refresh. During the window when the extensions are not present in the subject. If a connection to a broker is reattempted, it fails with the error that the extensions are missing.\r\n\r\nSee [KAFKA-14062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14062) for more information.\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n----\r\nIn clients, a Subject object is maintained which contains two sets each for Private and Public Credentials. Public Credentials includes the extensions. These values are stored in a `SaslExtensions` object which internally maintains these in a HashMap. \r\n\r\nAt the time of token refresh, a SaslExtensions object with these extensions is added to the public credentials set. As a next step, the refresh thread tries to logout the client for the older credentials. So it tries to remove the older token (private credential) and older SaslExtensions object (public credential) from the sets maintained in the Subject object. \r\n\r\nSaslExtensions Class overrides the `equals` and `hashcode` functions and directly calls the `equals` and `hashcode` functions of HashMap. So at the time refresh when a new SaslExtensions object is added, because the extension values don't change, it results in a no-op because the hashes of the existing SaslExtensions object and the new object will be equals. But in the logout step, the only SaslExtensions object present in the set gets removed.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the extensions in 1st refresh, the extensions will get added again at the time of 2nd refresh. So, this addition and removal keep happening alternatively.\r\n\r\nThe addition and removal of private credentials (tokens) from Subject work just fine because the tokens are always different.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

PR is to consolidate https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12338 and https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12384\r\n\r\nIn order to integrate with the state updater, we would need to refactor the TaskManager and Task interfaces. This PR achieved the following purposes:\r\n\r\n1. Separate active and standby tasks in the Tasks placeholder, plus adding pendingActiveTasks and pendingStandbyTasks into Tasks. The exposed active/standby tasks from the Tasks set would only be mutated by a single thread, and the pending tasks hold for those tasks that are assigned but cannot be actively managed yet. For now they include two scenarios: a) tasks from unknown sub-topologies and hence cannot be initialized, b) tasks that are pending for being recycled from active to standby and vice versa. Note case b) would be added in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n2. Extract any logic that mutates a task out of the Tasks / TaskCreators. Tasks should only be a place for maintaining the set of tasks, but not for manipulations of a task; and TaskCreators should only be used for creating the tasks, but not for anything else. These logic are all migrated into TaskManger.\r\n\r\n3. While doing 2) I noticed we have a couple of minor issues in the code where we duplicate the closing logics, so I also cleaned them up in the following way:\r\na) When closing a task, we first trigger the corresponding closeClean/Dirty function; then we remove the task from `Tasks` bookkeeping, and for active task we also remove its task producer if EOS-V1 is used.\r\nb) For closing dirty, we swallow the exception from close call and the remove task producer call; for closing clean, we store the thrown exception from either close call or the remove task producer, and then rethrow at the end of the caller. The difference though is that, for the exception from close call we need to retry close it dirty; for the exception from the remove task producer we do not need to re-close it dirty.\r\n\r\n###

cleaning a topic with transactional data, if the keys used in the user data happen to conflict with the keys in the transaction markers, it is possible for the markers to get removed before the corresponding data from the transaction is removed. This results in a hanging transaction or the loss of the transaction's atomicity since it would effectively get bundled into the next transaction in the log. Currently control records are excluded when building the offset map, but not when doing the cleaning. This patch fixes the problem by checking for control batches in the `shouldRetainRecord` callback.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

scenario is explained in details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13474 but as a summary:\r\nWhen a certificate is rotated on a broker via dynamic configuration and the previous certificate expires, the broker to controller connection starts failing with `SSL Handshake failed`.\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nA similar fix was earlier performed in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6721 but when `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` was introduced in v2.7, we didn't enable dynamic reconfiguration for it's channel.\r\n\r\n**Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)**\r\nAdd a test which fails prior to the fix done in the PR and succeeds afterwards. The bug wasn't caught earlier because there was no test coverage to validate the scenario.\r\n\r\nNote: I would suggest that we backport this fix to all versions until 2.7\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-05T18:05:36Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T10:33:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-09T10:06:02Z","merged_at":"2022-07-09T10:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc6e91e19920a41a56ff60c65e3b9719f4506977","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bad8b02393fda15e7365aa0d169c3e6ece81ca64","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:KAFKA-13474","ref":"KAFKA-13474","sha":"bad8b02393fda15e7365aa0d169c3e6ece81ca64","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

team,\r\n\r\nMinor suggestion to lower that new log to DEBUG as we used not to have any INFO log in this class and it looks like something has changed when you start a client while it's just the first

the new `SourceConnector::exactlyOnceSupport` method in the source connector used by MirrorMaker 2. Since the connector tracks offsets using the Kafka Connect framework, exactly-once support is possible. However, we require that the consumer used to read from the source cluster is configured with the `read_committed` isolation level, since otherwise records from aborted and uncommitted transactions would be replicated.\r\n\r\nDoes not implement the new `SourceConnector::canDefineTransactionBoundaries` method as the default is to return `ConnectorTransactionBoundaries.UNSUPPORTED`, which is correct for this connector as it is incapable of defining its own transaction boundaries\r\n\r\nA new integration test suite is also added for MirrorMaker 2 with exactly-once support enabled, with some small tweaks to run these tests correctly and account for changes in the Connect framework's behavior with exactly-once support.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

The call may be expensive and cause lock contention.  Now the call is moved back outside of the lock.\r\n\r\n- The reference to ProducerRecord was held in the batch completion callback, so it was kept alive as long as the batch was alive, which may increase the amount of memory in certain scenario and cause excessive GC work.  Now the reference is reset early, so the ProducerRecord lifetime isn't bound to the batch lifetime.\r\n\r\nTested via manually crafted benchmark, lock profile shows ~15% lock contention on the

methods\r\n\r\nHaving \"async\" in Kafka consumer API might encourage users to expect that there is some other internal thread that might deliver offset-commit confirmation, but actually it's usercode that needs to `poll()` to get the response. This PR attempts to add some disclaimer to cover this situation.\r\n\r\nIn example, the following blocks infinitely:\r\n```\r\nfinal Consumer<byte[], byte[]> kc = ....\r\nkc.assign(Collections.singleton(new TopicPartition(\"mytopic\", 0)));\r\nkc.poll(2000);\r\nfinal CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1); // The latch should be released when we get a response.  \r\nkc.commitAsync(new OffsetCommitCallback() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onComplete(final Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata> offsets, final Exception exception) {\r\n        latch.countDown();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\nlatch.await(); // <- Never releases; adding something trivial like `kc.poll(300)`\r\n               // before the await does help, as then we kick off the NetworkClient to do the polling for responses.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn detail:\r\n`KafkaConsumer.commitAsync` calls only send the OFFSET_COMMIT requests, but do not wait for response (as they should be, as they are asynchronous after all) (the \"in-flight\" request is kept in NetworkClient's `inFlightRequests` collection).\r\nHowever, compared to Producer's asynchronous send API, there is no underlying worker thread that is going to get the data and invoke the callback - it is going to happen on the next NetworkClient interaction with remote (AFAICT anything that should finally invoke `NetworkClient.poll`).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

of emitting a warning when adding out-of-order (by timestamp)\r\nrecords to a `KTable`, we should discard these records silently.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this creates a problem for `KTable`s produced from a\r\nsource-topic that has been optimized with the source-topic optimization,\r\ni.e. when using `StreamsBuilder#table(...)`.\r\n\r\nIf a user topic that is being used as a changelog (by the source-topic\r\noptimiation) has compaction enabled, it's possible that the\r\ntopic-compaction will eliminate newer (by timestamp) records, because\r\ncompaction is (currently) offset-based.\r\n\r\nTo ensure we don't produce a `KTable` that is inconsistent with the\r\nsource-topic in this scenario, we must continue to add all records\r\nfrom these topics in to the materialized store, irrespective of\r\ntimestamp.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this, `KTableSource` is now explicitly instructed by the\r\ntopology when it's processing records from an optimized

think this is introduce in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13310.  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/ConsumerCoordinator.java#L752\r\n\r\nwe didn't wait for client to receive commit offset response here, so onJoinPrepareAsyncCommitCompleted will be false in cooperative rebalance, and client will loop in invoking onJoinPrepare.\r\n\r\ni think EAGER mode don't have this problem because it will revoke the partitions even if onJoinPrepareAsyncCommitCompleted=false and will not try to commit next round.\r\n\r\nBesides, there's also another bug found during fixing this bug. Before [KAFKA-13310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13310), we commitOffset sync with rebalanceTimeout, which will retry when retriable error until timeout. After [KAFKA-13310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13310), we thought we have retry, but we'll retry after partitions revoking. That is, even though the retried offset commit successfully, it still causes some partitions offsets un-committed, and after rebalance, other consumers will consume overlapping records.\r\n\r\n###
