patch adds a way for columns to provide GroupByVectorColumnSelectors, which controls how the groupBy engine operates on them. This mechanism is used by ExpressionVirtualColumn to provide an ExpressionDeferredGroupByVectorColumnSelector that uses the inputs of an expression as the grouping key. The actual expression evaluation is deferred until the grouped ResultRow is created.\r\n\r\nA new context parameter `deferExpressionDimensions` allows users to control when this deferred selector is used. The default is `fixedWidthNonNumeric`, which is a behavioral change from the prior behavior. Users can get the prior behavior by setting this to `singleString`.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks of a few selected queries from `SqlExpressionBenchmark` follow. Findings:\r\n\r\n- Query 26, `GROUP BY CONCAT(string2, '-', long2)`, speeds up when the expression is deferred.\r\n- Queries 22, 24, 30, and 31 slow down when the expression is deferred. These are `GROUP BY TIME_FLOOR(TIMESTAMPADD(DAY, -1, __time)`, `GROUP BY long1 * long2`, `GROUP BY CAST(long1 as BOOLEAN) AND CAST (long2 as BOOLEAN)`, and `GROUP BY long5 IS NULL, long3 IS NOT NULL`. All are simple expressions with numeric inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I think `fixedWidthNonNumeric` is a good default.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

This Balancer Uses [org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.EnumeratedDistribution](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.6.1/org/apache/commons/math3/distribution/EnumeratedDistribution.html#sample(int,%20T[])) to decide what servers to load segments to and what server to move a segment to. For choosing which server(s) to drop a segment from, it does not use this probabilistic sampling, but instead just orders the servers by % utilized in order to drop from the most \"full\" candidate server first.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the balancer is to drive a cluster's storage distribution towards uniform disk utilization % across historical servers.\r\n\r\nIt differs from the diskNormalized balancer in that this balancer is completely disconnected from the cost balancer. It is strictly assigning segment destinations by probabilistic sampling that EnumeratedDistribution uses.\r\n\r\n##### Replicating a segment\r\n\r\nAssign probabilities to every candidate server. The probability input for server s is a float between 0 and 1. The probability for a server correlates to it's utilization %. The most utilized server in the cluster has the lowest probability assigned and the least utilized server has the highest probability assigned.\r\n\r\nThis is where the impl gets a little funky compared to the other Balancers. The other balancers return an Iterator over all of the candidate servers after they have been sorted according to the balancer algorithm. For this new balancer, it is less straightforward. We sample the set of candidates with the aforementioned probabilities in mind (EnumeratedDistribution library handles all this for us) a number of times that is equal to the size of the provided candidate list. We then de-dup the list of sampled servers since it will likely - by design - have picked the higher probability servers multiple times. This means the return list to the caller is not going to have every candidate. The feelin is that this shouldn't be a problem when you have a meaningful number of historicals since the number of replicas is likely fairly low. However, the method signature could be changed to define a minimum number of servers returned if we needed to guarantee that N servers were in the iterable that the caller receives.\r\n\r\n##### Moving a segment\r\n\r\nAssign probabilities to every candidate server. The probability input for an individual server is a float between 0 and 1 that correlates to it's disk utilization %. The most utilized server in the cluster has the lowest probability assigned and the least utilized server has the highest probability assigned.\r\n\r\nSample from the set of candidate servers with the aforementioned probabilities in mind (EnumeratedDistribution library handles all this for us). Return the sampled server.\r\n\r\n##### Dropping a segment\r\n\r\nOrder the candidate servers in descending order by segment cache space utilization % and return an iterable over them. This pushes the cluster to drop from the \"most full\" servers first, working towards the ultimate goal of converging on a uniform utilization % across historical servers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?

This balancer will converge historical servers to a uniform level of storage consumption (expressed as a % of available storage utilized on each server). To enable this balancer, set `druid.coordinator.balancer.strategy` to `enumeratedDistribution`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `EnumeratedDistributionBalancerStrategy`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have updated https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/resources/defaultMetrics.json and added the `query/timeout/count`, `mergeBuffer/pendingRequests`, `ingest/events/processedWithError`, `ingest/notices/queueSize` and `segment/count` metrics. \r\n\r\nI also changed the description for `query/interrupted/count` according to https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/metrics/\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved: Add some missing metrics to the default prometheus-emitter mapping\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for loading a specified subset of lookups in the task layer via a new class named `LookupLoadingSpec`. It updates the `LookupReferencesManager` to support 3 modes:\r\n1. Load all the lookups if `LookupLoadingSpec.mode` is `ALL`.\r\n2. Don't load any lookups if `LookupLoadingSpec.mode` is `NONE`.\r\n3. Load only the specified lookups if `LookupLoadingSpec.mode` is `ONLY_REQUIRED`. The lookups to load are consumed using `LookupLoadingSpec#getLookupsToLoad()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the `KillUnusedSegmentsTask` to return an empty set of lookups to load, as this task has no dependency on any lookups. Future work would involve implementing this functionality for other tasks, depending on their dependency on lookups.\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\n1. I did some manual testing which involved running `KillUnusedSegmentsTask` with different implementations of `getLookupsToLoad()` method, to test the behavior of all the 3 aforementioned modes.\r\n2. Added or updated unit tests to validate the changed functionality.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T10:00:51Z","updated_at":"2024-05-10T17:38:44Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T01:49:59Z","merged_at":"2024-04-29T01:49:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d2cae40c3fd941658641d8a753735ec6d74340e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nReviving an old PR by @YongGang . When a task fails due to lock revocation, the status requests to check the overlord log. This feels like a common enough failure to surface in the task status itself. This change does a couple of things:\r\n* Include lock revocation exception message in the task status\r\n* Increase the error message length for the status from 100 to slightly larger than 1024.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Updated ISEs to use the exception when appropriate.\r\n * Updated `TaskStatus` truncation logic to be a bit more helpful.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

Task or Supervisor must not have its segment granularity strictly finer than its query granularity.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nToday, an appending task fails during segment allocation in cases of such misconfiguration. When such a supervisor is submitted, the tasks are spawned and failed repetitively and this leads to a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a check to ensure that the UniformGranularitySpec has a segment granularity equal to or coarser than its query granularity.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nVerified that tasks cannot be submitted with a segment granularity finer than the query granularity.\r\nSimilarly, verified that a new supervisor with such a misconfigured granularity spec cannot be submitted. Also, ensured that an existing supervisor is unaffected after attempting to submit such a supervisor with the same id.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSubmission of ingestion tasks and supervisors having segment granularities strictly finer than their query granularities is now disallowed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nMSQ sorts the columns in a highly specialized manner by byte comparisons. As such the values are serialized differently. This works well for the primitive types and primitive arrays, however complex types cannot be serialized specially. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support for sorting the complex columns by deserializing the value from the field and comparing it via the type strategy. This is a lot slower than the byte comparisons, however, it's the only way to support sorting on complex columns that can have arbitrary serialization not optimized for MSQ. \r\n\r\nThe primitives and the arrays are still compared via the byte comparison, therefore this doesn't affect the performance of the queries supported before the patch. If there's a sorting key with mixed complex and primitive/primitive array types, for example: `longCol1 ASC, longCol2 ASC, complexCol1 DESC, complexCol2 DESC, stringCol1 DESC, longCol3 DESC, longCol4 ASC`, the comparison will happen like:\r\n\r\n* `longCol1, longCol2 (ASC)` - Compared together via byte-comparison, since both are byte comparable and need to be sorted in ascending order\r\n* `complexCol1 (DESC)` - Compared via deserialization, cannot be clubbed with any other field\r\n* `complexCol2 (DESC)` - Compared via deserialization, cannot be clubbed with any other field, even though the prior field was a complex column with the same order\r\n* `stringCol1, longCol3 (DESC)` - Compared together via byte-comparison, since both are byte comparable and need to be sorted in descending order\r\n* `longCol4 (ASC)` - Compared via byte-comparison, couldn't be coalesced with the previous fields as the direction was different\r\n\r\nThis way, we only deserialize the field wherever required\r\n\r\n## Backward Compatibility\r\nNo backward incompatible change has been made.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\nComplex types can expose and implement special handling for types such as SerializablePairs, which can be serialized in a byte-comparable way and won't need to be deserialized for comparison. It will fit in easily with the current changes. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ now supports sorting on all the complex columns, and grouping on the complex columns that support it. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

a api on the overlord to order a task group to checkpoint and exit early before taskDuration is met. This is helpful when trying to update old middle managers (by ending the existing tasks on them) and also could potentially let druid run streaming tasks indefinitely (since they can do intermediate checkpointing and can always be shutdown manually when needed).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Add an API that given a supervisor-id, task-group-id, will tell the tasks in that task group to shutdown the next time the supervisor loop runs.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nI thought integrating this into the checkTaskDuration flow was the best way to to this since it does everything needed during a regular handoff (when taskDuration is exceeded), and the logic we want here is exactly the same as what is done during regular handoff (as opposed to a intermediate handoff or a supervisor pause)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdd new API for telling streaming task groups to exit early.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SupervisorManager`\r\n * `SupervisorResource`\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Note\r\n- __This PR does not pertain to the audit logging system__ used by Druid for auditing all major update actions such as run a task, update rules, update dynamic configs, create a supervisor, etc. That information is persisted in __`druid_audit`__ metadata table (if `druid.audit.manager.type=sql`) or simply logged.\r\n- Instead, __it deals with the audit logging used only for task actions__ i.e. the __`druid_taskLog`__ metadata table.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTask action audit logging was first deprecated and disabled by default in Druid 0.13, #6368.\r\n\r\nAs called out in the original discussion #5859, there are several drawbacks to persisting task action audit logs. \r\n- Only usage of the task audit logs is to serve the API `/indexer/v1/task/{taskId}/segments`\r\nwhich returns the list of segments created by a task.\r\n- The use case is really narrow and no prod clusters really use this information.\r\n- There can be better ways of obtaining this information, such as the metric\r\n`segment/added/bytes` which reports both the segment ID and task ID\r\nwhen a segment is committed by a task. We could also include committed segment IDs in task reports.\r\n- A task persisting several segments would bloat up the audit logs table putting unnecessary strain\r\non metadata storage.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Remove `TaskAuditLogConfig`\r\n- Remove method `TaskAction.isAudited()`. No task action is audited anymore.\r\n- Remove `SegmentInsertAction` as it is not used anymore. `SegmentTransactionalInsertAction` is the new incarnation which has been in use for a while.\r\n- Deprecate `MetadataStorageActionHandler.addLog()` and `getLogs()`. These are not used anymore but need to be retained for backward compatibility of extensions.\r\n- Do not create `druid_taskLog` metadata table anymore.\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n- Task action audit logging was deprecated in Druid 0.13 and is being completely removed in this release.\r\n- The API `/indexer/v1/task/{taskId}/segments` is not supported anymore and will give a 404 NOT FOUND response.\r\n- Druid will not write to or read from the metadata table `druid_taskLog` anymore.\r\n- The property `druid.indexer.auditlog.enabled` will be ignored by Druid.\r\n- The metric `task/action/log/time` will not be emitted anymore.\r\n\r\n### Extension dev notes\r\nThe changes in this PR are backward compatible with all existing metadata storage extensions.\r\nThe methods `addLog` and `getLogs` of `MetadataStorageActionHandler` are now deprecated\r\nand not used by the Druid code.\r\nAny new metadata storage extension need not implement these methods.\r\n\r\n### Rolling upgrade concerns\r\nNo upgrade concerns as none of the tasks use the `SegmentInsertAction`.\r\n\r\n### Future solutions\r\n\r\n#### Which task created a segment?\r\nA more preferable approach would be to simply add a `task_id` column in the `segments` table.\r\nSomething similar has been recently done for pending segments in #16144.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could also be possible to determine the list of segments committed by a task by inspecting\r\nthe reports of the task or emitted metrics.\r\n\r\n#### Which user created a segment?\r\nTask submission is already logged and/or persisted depending on configuration by the Druid audit system.\r\nOnce we can associate segments to task IDs, we would also be able to identify which user created a given\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a

note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks.

Description\r\nThis PR switches the `OR` filter \"partial index\" value matchers to use `PeekableIntIterator` instead of `IntIterator` which can dramatically improve performance when these are used on top of an index offset which has a small number of set bits (since we can use `advanceIfNeeded` instead of looping to check `next` until we seek the correct offset). These matchers are used when some sub-filters support indexes we make a synthetic value matcher that checks the index instead of actually evaluating the matchers, which can be quite beneficial, but in certain scenarios can also be rather expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe added benchmark is one such expensive scenario, where the OR filter is nested under an `AND` filter. The equality clause of the AND is rather selective, but the first clause of the `OR` matches all rows, so the while loop of the previous code needs to call `hasNext`/`next` quite a lot to seek to the next offset.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark              (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (storageType)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt   Score    Error

aggregators can contain some cached objects within them, such as Memory references or HLL Unions. Prior to this patch, VectorGrouper implementations were not releasing this state when resetting their own internal state, which could lead to excessive memory use.\r\n\r\nThis patch renames AggregatorAdapater#close to \"reset\", and updates VectorGrouper implementations to call this reset method whenever they reset their internal state.\r\n\r\nThe base method on BufferAggregator and VectorAggregator remains named \"close\", for compatibility with existing extensions, but the contract is adjusted to say that the aggregator may be reused after the method is called. All existing implementations in core already adhere to this new contract.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch harmonizes buffer sketch helpers to call their clear method \"clear\" rather than a mix of \"clear\" and \"close\".

\"clear\".)","created_at":"2024-04-16T16:35:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:22:45Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T09:39:25Z","merged_at":"2024-04-24T09:39:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"274ccbfd85c86a1333344c4ac2aedce241027728","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

updates:\r\n\r\n1) The parameter \"selectionRowCount\" on \"makeFilterBundle\" is renamed\r\n   \"applyRowCount\", and redefined as an upper bound on rows remaining\r\n   after short-circuiting (rather than number of rows selected so far).\r\n   This definition works better for OR filters, which pass through the\r\n   FALSE set rather than the TRUE set to the next subfilter.\r\n\r\n2) AndFilter uses min(applyRowCount, indexIntersectionSize) rather\r\n   than using selectionRowCount for the first subfilter and indexIntersectionSize\r\n   for each filter thereafter. This improves accuracy when the incoming\r\n   applyRowCount is smaller than the row count from the first few indexes.\r\n\r\n3) OrFilter uses min(applyRowCount, totalRowCount - indexUnionSize) rather\r\n   than applyRowCount for subfilters. This allows an OR filter to pass\r\n   information about short-circuiting to its subfilters.\r\n\r\nTo help write tests for this, the patch also moves the sampled wikiticker data file from sql to processing.","created_at":"2024-04-16T06:44:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:24:49Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T05:42:28Z","merged_at":"2024-04-17T05:42:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccc1ffb03238c2318a622a95e808b83952abd586","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

As majority of the advancements that we are making in batch ingestion are in MSQ, it is imperative that we support compaction on MSQ to make Compaction more robust and possibly faster. For instance, we have seen OOM errors in native compaction that MSQ could have handled by its auto-calculation of tuning parameters. \r\n\r\nThis PR enables compaction on MSQ to remove the dependency on native engine. \r\n\r\n#### Main changes:\r\n* `DataSourceCompactionConfig` now has an additional field `engine` that can be one among `[native, msq]` with `native` being the default.\r\n*  if engine is MSQ, `CompactSegments` duty assigns all available compaction task slots to the launched `CompactionTask` to ensure full capacity is available to MSQ. This is to avoid stalling which could happen in case a fraction of the tasks were allotted and they eventually fell short of the number of tasks required by the MSQ engine to run the compaction.\r\n* `ClientCompactionTaskQuery` has a new field `ClientCompactionRunnerInfo` with just one `Engine` subfield.\r\n* `CompactionTask` now has `CompactionRunner` interface instance with its implementations `NativeCompactinRunner` in core and `MSQCompactionRunner` in the `druid-multi-stage-query` extension. . The objectmapper deserializes `ClientCompactionRunnerInfo` in `ClientCompactionTaskQuery` to the `CompactionRunner` instance that is mapped to the specified type [`native`, `msq`]. \r\n* `CompactTask` uses the `CompactionRunner` instance it receives to create the indexing tasks.\r\n* `CompactionTask` to `MSQControllerTask` conversion logic checks whether metrics are present in the segment schema. If present, the task is created with a native group-by query; if not, the task is issued with a scan query. The `storeCompactionState` flag is set in the context.\r\n* Each created `MSQControllerTask` is launched in-place and its `TaskStatus` tracked to determine the final status of \r\nthe `CompactionTask`. The id of each of these tasks is the same as that of `CompactionTask` since otherwise, the workers will be unable to determine the controller task's location for communication (as they haven't been launched via the overlord). \r\n\r\n####  Some things to note:\r\n\r\n* The context specified in `DataSourceCompactionConfig` is passed as is to the MSQControllerTask and hence can contain MSQ context params as well, with the exception of `rowsPerSegment` -- which will be overridden by either `targetRowsPerSegment` or `maxRowsPerSegment` if specified in a `partitionsSpec`. \r\n* `maxRowsInMemory` param is only considered if specified in the context. The value in [DataSourceCompactionConfig.tuningConfig](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#automatic-compaction-tuningconfig) is not considered as it is set to a default value (1M) if unspecified by a user, so it is indistinguishable between coming from the user or via the default. \r\n* If no `maxNumTasks` value is specified in the `taskContext`, `min(availableCompactionTaskSlots, 5)` is allotted to MSQ compaction tasks.\r\n* `rollup:true` without any `metricsSpec` de-duplicates rows since all columns are then treated as dimensions -- just as in native compaction.\r\n\r\n#### Currently unsupported for MSQ Compaction:\r\n* Update of cluster-level default compaction engine. Current default is `native` which can be updated at a per-datasource level. The cluster-level update API will come in a follow-up PR.\r\n* Grouping on multi-value columns. The flag `groupByEnableMultiValueUnnesting` is disabled. Only array-type columns are supported\r\n* `partitionsSpec` of type `HashedParititionsSpec`. Only `DimensionRangePartitionsSpec` and `DynamicPartitionsSpec` works.\r\n*  `maxTotalRows` in `DynamicPartitionsSpec`. Only `maxRowsPerSegment` works.\r\n*  `rollup` set to false in `granularitySpec` when `metricsSpec` is specified.  Only `rollup` set to `true` works with a non-empty `metricsSpec`.\r\n* Aggregators in `metricsSpec` where `fieldName != name` OR (internal) `aggregatorFactory.class() != aggregatorFactory.getCombiningFactory.class()`. _This is a major limitation that will be addressed in a follow-up PR_\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

httpsKeepAliveSocketFactory into a singleton for performance improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Java Storage Client Library 8.6.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the commitWriteOnInputStreamException option to BlobRequestOptions, which will allow the user to configure whether any data staged through openWrite when using the upload(InputStream, long) method will be committed upon failures in the InputStream.</li>\n<li>Disabled httpsKeepAlive by default as it can introduce some perf issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Java Storage Client Library 8.6.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in the pom that disrupted the ability to download from maven central.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Java Storage Client Library 8.6.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in BlobInputStream that would return extra zeros at the end of the stream if the data was encrypted using client-side encryption.</li>\n<li>MD5 checks on BlobInputStream are skipped if data being downloaded is also being decrypted via client-side encryption, even if disableMd5Calculation is set to false. Previously this check would always fail as MD5 is calculated on cipher text on upload but was calculated on plaintext on download.</li>\n<li>Added a workaround to a JDK bug that would ignore connection timeouts on retries, causing hangs in some scenarios.

patch adds support for Delta filters in the Delta Lake input source. Before this patch, the Delta Lake connector would read _all_ Delta files in the latest snapshot, which could be inefficient. With the addition of filters, the connector translates them into Delta predicates, enabling the pushing down of filter predicates to the underlying Delta Kernel. This allows for the Kernel to perform data skipping and read only Delta files that match the filter predicates.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn example of a `>=` range filter:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"employee-filter1\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT \"name\", MILLIS_TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(\"birthday\" AS BIGINT) * 1000) AS __time, \"id\", \"salary\" FROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\r\n      \"type\": \"delta\",\r\n      \"tablePath\": \"/Users/foo/employee-table\",\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"type\": \">=\",\r\n        \"column\": \"name\",\r\n        \"value\": \"Employee3\"\r\n      }\r\n    }',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n) EXTEND (\"birthday\" BIGINT, \"name\" VARCHAR, \"id\" BIGINT, \"age\" BIGINT, \"salary\" FLOAT)\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\nCLUSTERED BY name\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example of an `AND` filter:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"employee-filter2\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT \"name\", MILLIS_TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(\"birthday\" AS BIGINT) * 1000) AS __time, \"id\", \"salary\" FROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\r\n      \"type\": \"delta\",\r\n      \"tablePath\": \"/Users/foo/employee-table\",\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"and\",\r\n        \"filters\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"<=\",\r\n            \"column\": \"age\",\r\n            \"value\": \"30\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \">=\",\r\n            \"column\": \"name\",\r\n            \"value\": \"Employee4\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }}',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n) EXTEND (\"birthday\" BIGINT, \"name\" VARCHAR, \"id\" BIGINT, \"age\" BIGINT, \"salary\" FLOAT)\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\nCLUSTERED BY name\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Core changes:\r\n- Add `DeltaFilter` interface and implementations for  `and`, `or`, `not`, `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.\r\n- Expose optional `filter` in the `DeltaInputSource`. If supplied, the filters are translated to Delta `Predicate` that is pushed down to the Kernel for pruning out data files.\r\n- The design of these objects is similar to `IcebergFilter` where the filters can be an expression tree that translates nicely to underlying Delta Predicate to be used in the Kernel. Updated ingestion and delta docs to show the usage of these filter objects.\r\n\r\n### Test changes\r\n- Add a new Delta table `employee-delta-table-partitioned-name` partitioned by employee name. Added instructions on how to generate in the test README.\r\n- The newly generated Delta table expected rows and schema is hardcoded in the `PartitionedDeltaTable`. The existing non-partitioned table is moved to `NonPartitionedDeltaTable`. The test classes can further be cleaned up by having a common `DeltaTestTable` interface. I can refactor and clean that up later when we add more test tables as needed.\r\n- Add tests for the filter POJOs in the `delta/filter` package.\r\n- Add serde test for `DeltaInputSourceSerdeTest` to test out jackson serialization of the input source objects.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nSupport for filters in the Delta Lake input source has been added. Utilize the Delta filter to prune unnecessary Delta files and read only data that matches the filter predicates. Please refer to the documentation for instructions on how to use filters during ingestion.\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DeltaFilter` interface and its implementations\r\n * `DeltaInputSource`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nIn kinesis, lag is computed in minutes rather than count of records as done in kafka. If each shard has a lag of 1 min and there are 10 shards, we were computing that there was 10 mins of lag for auto scaling decisions, but we should be only looking at the max and make the auto scaling decisions. On the other hand, for kafka, the lag considered for autoscaling is total as previously.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFor kinesis streams, autoscaling is now done on max lag per shard rather than the total lag for all shards.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `LagStats.java`\r\n * `LagMetric.java`\r\n * `LabBasedAutoScaler.java`\r\n * `Supervisor.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\nStatsd client sometimes drops metrics when this [queueSize](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent&code-lang=java#client-instantiation-parameters) of statsd client with max unprocessed messages is completely full. This causes some high cardinality metrics like per partition lag being droppped. \r\nThere are multiple [parameters](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent&code-lang=java#client-instantiation-parameters) of statsdclient that can be initialized and can help increase the load/capacity of client to not to drop metrics more frequently. \r\nProperties like `queueSize`, `poolSize`, `processorWorkers` and `senderWorkers` will now be configurable at runtime\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16271.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If the actual type of the generic type is Integer, a cast exception will occur. So overloaded methods with parameters such as int, long, boolean, and String need to be removed, and used Object instead to solve runtime exceptions caused by generic type.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\nThe `useMaxMemoryEstimates` parameter was introduced as a way to switch between old and new methods of estimating memory footprint while building an `OnHeapIncrementalIndex`. The default value of this parameter has been `false` (i.e. use newer more accurate estimates) for several Druid releases now, and has been found to be very stable.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are meant to align the usage of this parameter in Hadoop ingestion with native ingestion. Eventually, the parameter `useMaxMemoryEstimates` will be completely removed from Druid.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add optional tuning config for Hadoop jobs: `useMaxMemoryEstimates`\r\n- Use default value of `false` to align with current native batch ingestion\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-13T12:07:15Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:46:49Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T02:37:21Z","merged_at":"2024-04-26T02:37:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b6748bdc95f9bde1662e2b37ea0fad959110a97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"abhishekrb19","id":8687261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODcyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8687261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekrb19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows catalog tables to be defined without explicit segment granularities defined. DML queries on such tables will either need to have the `PARTITIONED BY` clause specified, or the table will need to be updated to include a defined segment granularity for DML queries to be validated properly. This PR is built on top of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16223, so that change should be merged first\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

core change is to remove ` implements QueryComponentSupplier, PlannerComponentSupplier` from `BaseCalciteQueryTest` - and make those methods override methods of a descendant of

are a few issues with using Jackson serialization in sending datasketches between controller and worker in MSQ. This caused a blowup due to holding multiple copies of the sketch being stored. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve this by switching to deserializing the sketch payload without Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a new query parameter used during communication between controller and worker while fetching sketches, \"sketchEncoding\".\r\n - If the value of this parameter is OCTET, the sketch is returned as a binary encoding, done by `ClusterByStatisticsSnapshotSerde`. \r\n- If the value is not the above, the sketch is encoded by Jackson as before.\r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\n#### Query param\r\n\r\nThe worker client now sends a query parameter which specifies the desired format with the request to fetch the sketch. If the worker receives this parameter, it returns the response encoded as a byte array, with the response header \"Content-Type\":\"octet-stream\". If the flag is missing, it defaults to the older behavior of Jackson serialized array.\r\n\r\nThe newer worker client checks the header and deserializes the response accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf a newer controller is running with an older worker, the worker will ignore the query parameter, and the controller will not see the response header, and use Jackson deserialization. \r\n\r\nIf a newer worker is running with an older controller, the query param will not be sent to the worker, which will again default to using Jackson, which the controller will automatically handle.\r\n\r\nThe above has been tested with an older WorkerClient and newer WorkerChatHandler, and with an older WorkerChatHandler and WorkerClient.\r\n\r\n### Byte format\r\n\r\nThe byte format contains a currently empty header byte, which can be used to store version information. This should allow updating the format in the future, if future versions check the header and deserialize accordingly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

adds support for reading partial data from parquet files on S3 or GCS. The exact mechanics of doing so are left to the parquet library. The PR just enables everything to be wired so the parquet extension can invoke necessary operations on classes sitting in other extensions.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This eliminates overlord from handling duplicate requests and hence prevents ingestion lags. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

switches off vectorization tests completely, and cannotVectorize turns vectorization tests into negative tests. It doesn't make sense to use them together, so this patch makes it an error to do so, and cleans up cases where both are mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis patch also has the effect of changing various tests from skipVectorize to cannotVectorize, because in the past when both were mentioned, skipVectorize would take priority.\r\n\r\nThis patch also uncovered and fixes a bug with `StringAnyAggregatorFactory`,

Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a configurable `druid.sql.planner.bloat` parameter in CalciteRulesManager.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the problem when complicated nested sql queries which where working before Druid 29.0.0 (1.21.0 calcite version) are being rejected by calcite planner.\r\n\r\nWith exception:\r\n`There are not enough rules to produce a node with desired properties: convention=DRUID, sort=[]`\r\n\r\nAppears that the exceptiom is being thrown, when the root `RelNode` which initially is instance of `AbstractConverter` is being treated as `ProjectMergeRule`, which counts the result of merge not optimal and reject merging, which means that transformation of AbstractConverter [is not happening](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/75750b78b5ac692caa654f506fc1515d4d3991d6/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/ProjectMergeRule.java#L129,), so at the end of the day this `AbstractConverter` instance keeps skipping bestCost initialization, because it returns default [infinite value](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/75750b78b5ac692caa654f506fc1515d4d3991d6/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/plan/volcano/AbstractConverter.java#L75)  which is being skipped by  [VolcanoPlanner](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/75750b78b5ac692caa654f506fc1515d4d3991d6/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/plan/volcano/VolcanoPlanner.java#L984). That's why bestCost to root relNode is never set which is causing [exception](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/fe0da064dc3081b140e3c84e109aed63f202a4af/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/plan/volcano/RelSubset.java#L638) \r\nThis issue is probably caused by lots of optimizations in `VolcanoPlanner `and `ProjectMergeRule` and looks like as a calcite bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nCreated workaround: configurable `druid.sql.planner.bloat` parameter, which should be set on broker `jvm.conf`,  it will adjust the limits of `ProjectMergeRule` result cost and could allow running complex queries(default value 100, suggested 1000, but it depends on data to be processed). \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CalciteRulesManager`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Problem:\r\n\r\nWhen `druid.coordinator.kill.period` is set to something other than the coordinator's indexing period, it can cause confusion regarding when the duty will run. Please see https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15911 for example. Also, the default `P1D` may be overly conservative for most users as noted in [this comment]( https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15912#issuecomment-1954275964). \r\n\r\nSeparately, the default value of the dynamic coordinator config `killTaskSlotRatio` was previously `1.0`, which means virtually all available slots in a cluster can be used by the `KillUnusedSegments` duty, starving any other tasks in the system.\r\n\r\n#### Fix:\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15911. With sufficient guard rails available in the kill duty, the duty can just run regularly at the same time as the coordinator's indexing period. \r\n\r\n- By default, when `druid.coordinator.kill.period` is not set explicitly, it will take the value of `druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod` (whether it's the default or an overridden value)\r\n- As before, an operator can choose to override `druid.coordinator.kill.period` and this will take precedence over the default behavior noted above.\r\n- Updated default value of `killTaskSlotRatio` to 0.1. This means with the default dynamic coordinator config, the `KillUnusedSegments` duty will at most take only 10% of the available cluster capacity task slots.\r\n\r\nWe have been successfully running the auto-kill duty in production with `druid.coordinator.kill.period` set to `druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod`, even at `PT15M`. Note that we could deprecate `druid.coordinator.kill.period`, but in the ethos of providing flexibility to operators, this patch doesn't do so.\r\n\r\n#### Other related changes\r\n- The eternity interval comment is inaccurate and a remnant of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16094, so removed the relevant javadoc\r\n- Fix typo in `CoordinatorCompactionConfig`\r\n- Break up the tests in `DruidCoordinatorConfigTest`\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n- The default value for `druid.coordinator.kill.period` (if unspecified) has changed from `P1D` to the value of `druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod`. Operators can choose to override `druid.coordinator.kill.period` and that will take precedence over the default behavior.\r\n- The default value for the coordinator dynamic config `killTaskSlotRatio` is updated from `1.0` to `0.1`. This ensures that that kill tasks take up only 1 task slot right out-of-the-box instead of taking up all the task slots.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-08T21:32:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:25:09Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T01:56:17Z","merged_at":"2024-04-15T01:56:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"041d0bff5e0c983660a8eaaf72fd3b9aedf9f976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DefaultFramedOnHeapAggregatable.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11003\">#11003</a>) (0d749c594)</li>\n<li>api: Stabilize server.getListenerSockets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10910\">#10910</a>) (ff34d51c7)</li>\n<li>servlet: Introduce ServletServerBuilder.buildServlet(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10921\">#10921</a>) (257d1c2db)</li>\n<li>api: Allow configuration of the queued byte threshold at which a Stream is considered not ready (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10977\">#10977</a>) (2c83ef063)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<p>xds, dual stack, happy eyeballs: Support dual stack in xds, change list includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable new PickFirst lb policy by default. The new PickFirst implements subchannel picking logic.  (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11002\">#11002</a>) (8a9ce990b)</li>\n<li>EDS resource now supports additional addresses (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11011\">#11011</a>) (38f968faf)</li>\n<li>Change address based outlier detection to endpoint based (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10939\">#10939</a>) (c61fe6980)</li>\n<li>Enable Happy Eyeballs by default (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11022\">#11022</a>) (51f811df8)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>rls: Adding extra debug logs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10902\">#10902</a>) (eba699ad1)</li>\n<li>binder: Add missing Android API annotations (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10841\">#10841</a>) (ce2adcca9)</li>\n<li>core: Provide DEADLINE_EXCEEDED insights for context deadline (3abab95e7). When the deadline triggered and the deadline was set on the RPC via the stub or CallOptions, gRPC would gather additional debugging information to help understand where the RPC took so long. However if the deadline came from io.grpc.Context the error was simply “context timed out.” Now the debugging information is provided in both cases</li>\n<li>examples: Fix file paths in debug example README (e19f1f15a)</li>\n<li>compiler: implement ability to skip generation of javax annotation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10927\">#10927</a>) (0d39c2c70). Pass the option JakartaMode=omit to protoc-gen-grpc-java when generating code</li>\n<li>xds: Get rid of xDS v2 proto dependencies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10968\">#10968</a>) (feab4e544). <code>grpc-xds</code> jar size has decreased by 35%.</li>\n<li>xds: Support retrieving names from wrapped resource containers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10975\">#10975</a>) (867e46940)</li>\n<li>netty: improve server handling of writes to reset streams (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10258\">#10258</a>) (a68399a9b)</li>\n<li>api: Fix a typo in ServerInterceptor JavaDoc (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10990\">#10990</a>) (0b82f0126)</li>\n<li>servlet: Check log fine level before hex string conversion. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11038\">#11038</a>)</li>\n<li>auth: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (1.63.x backport) <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11050\">#11050</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Copy data in least request to avoid picker data race (f4cc166f1). This fixes a possible regression introduced in 1.60.0. Auditing the buggy code showed it unlikely to cause problems in practice, but that was more by happenstance than by design</li>\n<li>xds: Fix data race in the xds client that contacts the control plane (d7628a3ab)</li>\n<li>rls: Fix a local and remote race (aa9076812). The remote race could cause an RPC to hang until its deadline.
