fixing concurrent connections issue (#31710), the only blocker to making Storage API batch scalable is managing AppendRows throughput quota. The Storage API backend sets up this quota by having a short-term (cell) quota and a long-term (region) quota:\r\n- short-term quota can take up to 10s to refill\r\n- long-term quota is an aggregate of multiple cells and can take up to 10min to refill\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that all append operations are rejected while a quota is being refilled. \r\n\r\nThe standard throughput quota is not sufficient for large writes. Large pipeline will typically exhaust the long-term quota quickly, leading to consistent failures for 10 min. With enough failures (10 fails per bundle, 4 failed bundles per Dataflow pipeline), the pipeline eventually gives up and fails.\r\n\r\n### To deal with this, we should increase the number of retries so that pipelines can survive long enough until the throughput quota is refilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer:\r\n\r\nBefore this change, in the worst case where all append operations fail due to quota error, each bundle will retry for 66 seconds. After 4 bundle failures, a Dataflow pipeline can wait up to 4.4min to fail.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the worst-case wait time goes up to 10min per bundle, and 40min per pipeline.","created_at":"2024-07-11T00:26:24Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T19:23:05Z","closed_at":"2024-07-15T19:23:05Z","merged_at":"2024-07-15T19:23:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b61035f36fb099a8dcd39978c71779a2e81f957","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/22/labels","id":11146057,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAwi8tc4AqhNJ","number":22,"title":"2.58.0

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27085/files, we replaced `_MutationsBatcher` with `MutationsBatcher` from `google.cloud.bigtable.batcher`.\r\n\r\nHowever we didn't set `flush_count` and `max_row_bytes` of `MutationsBatcher` thus both constants `FLUSH_COUNT` and `MAX_ROW_BYTES` are currently not in used.\r\n\r\n=> This PR fixed that issue\r\n\r\n**Implication**\r\nAlthough, in `google.cloud.bigtable` library, `MutationsBatcher` also set default value for `flush-count` but there is currently a discrepancy between default value in documentation `1000` and actual default value `100` [See more](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigtable/blob/c573e9b695658f3e0c78eb3443d0cf26fea57da9/google/cloud/bigtable/batcher.py#L26)\r\n\r\nFor small/medium size use cases, there shouldn't be any problems. But I have 1 use case in which 1 million rows are written to Bigtable and `flush_count: 100` is too low which creates a lot of requests to Bigtable server.\r\n\r\nOne potential improvement is to allow both `flush_count` and `max_row_bytes` to be configurable. But this is open-to further discussion and out of scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

to improve SDF throughput to UnboundedReader impl by similarly performing blocking kafka polls in background thread and is cached.\r\nThis allows main partition consuming thread to be blocked less, prefetches, and caching reduces consuemr connections.\r\n\r\nRemaining work:\r\n- figure out how to address when a read is stopped due to splitting.  Currently records that were pulled off of background queue are lost.  Could perhaps be added back to the background queue in some way or we could change the interface to internally vend a record at a time and keep track of if it is consumed or not.\r\n- unit testing and performance testing\r\n- some of the timeout configuration plumbing needs to be fixed\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is the first part of a series of PRs which when brought together are equivalent to the change previously proposed in #31648 - the code of this PR doesn't introduce or remove any features from the schema inference mechanisms existing already, it merely prepares the ground for doing that in the subsequent PRs. It does so by passing on down the call hierarchy the `TypeDescriptor`s where previously the code worked with bare `Class`es. This way the full information carried by `TypeDescriptor`s regarding the type signatures is not lost, and the schema inference, as well as, on the fly bytecode generation facilities will be able to use it to infer beam schemas for generic java types. \r\n\r\nAdding the support for schema inference of generic types was proposed in a section of this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSQ9cnqtVM8ttJEuHBDE6hw4qjUuJy1dpZWB6IBTuOs/edit#heading=h.efves32ipr7n).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
