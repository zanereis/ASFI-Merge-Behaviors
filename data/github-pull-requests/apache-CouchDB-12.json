the previous attempt [1] we improved the logic by spawning workers on the matching target shards only. However, that wasn't enough as workers might still reject the passed in sequence from the old node when it asserts ownership\r\nlocally on each shard.\r\n\r\nRe-use the already existing replacement clause, where after uuid is matched, we try harder to find the highest viable sequence. To use the unit test setup as an example, if the shard moved from `node1` to `node2`, and recorded epoch `{node2, 10}` on the new node, then a sequence generated on `node1` before the move, for example `12`, would rewind down to `10` only when calculated on new location on `node2`, instead of being rewound all the way down to `0`.\r\n\r\n[1]

Overview\r\n\r\nRestores the ability for a couchdb administrator to set an upper limit to the duration of a continuous changes feed originally introduced in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/c6ad114ec797874a7eccf741fecb7139b117948b but lost in the FDB work.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSet up a continuous changes feed with a heartbeat, observe that it does not terminate naturally. Set the [fabric] changes_duration parameter to some positive integer value and retest. The changes feed should not return any new updates after that duration and the response will _end_ when the database is next updated (but will not return that update in the response).\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

do that by matching the comparator function behavior used during row [merging](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/fabric/src/fabric_view_map.erl#L244-L248) with the comparison function used when sorting the rows on view [shards](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/couch_mrview/src/couch_mrview_util.erl#L1103-L1107). This goes along with the constraint in the `lists:merge/3` docs which indicates that the input lists should be sorted according to the same [comparator](https://erlang.org/doc/man/lists.html#merge-3) as the one passed to the `lists:merge/3` call.\r\n\r\nThe stability of returned rows results from the case when both keys match as equal. Now `lists:merge/3` will favor the element in the existing rows list instead of always [replacing](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/lists.erl#L2668-L2675) the older matching row with the last arriving row, since now `less(A, A)` will be `false`, while previously it was `true`.\r\n\r\nThe fix was found by Adam when discussing issue

Overview\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this PR is to port https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3286 to 3.x. Which adds ability to run elixir suite against already running instance of CouchDB. However due to various changes to underlying build infrastructure few other commits and PRs were added into the mix.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3286\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3415\r\n- Extract support for `--erlang-config` flag from https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/fff07ba136cfa7433647e974355068b43e63199c \r\n\r\nThere were couple of fixups to make test suite pass\r\n\r\n- 3.x uses `Code.require_file` to inject `partition_helpers.exs` and `reshard_helpers.exs`. The original implementation of `Couch.Test.Suite` in [#3286](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3286) didn't support test helpers. \r\n- I found a bug in state management of `ensure_exunit_started()` function. We used `Process.gett/2` instead of `Process.put/2` (see [`ensure_exunit_started()`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3286/files#diff-50bb8399a196ad15a8f066b1eb5d95930c15b362737ccefbdaf3d4a2663ea397R156)).\r\n- few elixir tests were added to `main` without updating `test/elixir/test/config/suite.elixir`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1 Make sure that tests discovery works\r\n```\r\nMIX_ENV=integration mix build\r\nMIX_ENV=integration mix suite\r\n```\r\n2 Make sure the tests run and pass by using `make elixir-suite`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3286\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3415\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

as soon as one row returned, we immediately stopped, erroneously\r\nassuming that meta for all ranges have already been received. However, it was\r\npossible that we'd get meta from range `00-7f`, then a row from `00-7f` before\r\ngetting meta from `7f-ff` and thus we'd return an empty result.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue we simply re-use the already existing limit=0 clause from the\r\n[fabric_view:maybe_send_row/1](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/9f081914fe1fd7f31c2c1c7b3ead89427cf342f3/src/fabric/src/fabric_view.erl#L124-L134) function which will wait until there is a complete\r\nring before returning. That relies on updating the counters (the ring) only\r\nwith meta return and not with view rows, so if the ring is complete, we know we\r\nonly completed with meta.\r\n\r\nThe other issue with limit=0 clause was that it wasn't properly ack-ing the\r\nreceived row. Rows are ack-ed for [sorted=false](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/9f081914fe1fd7f31c2c1c7b3ead89427cf342f3/src/fabric/src/fabric_view_map.erl#L157) case below and for the regular\r\nlimit>0,

couch_icu_driver module\r\n\r\ncouch_icu_driver is only used for binary strings comparison in `couch_ejson_compare` when expression depth becomes greater than 10.\r\n\r\nThe logic for string comparison is identical to what `couch_ejson_compare` uses, so opt to just use `couch_ejson_compare` instead of keeping a whole other binary collation driver around.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a possible infinite loop if `couch_ejson_compare` nif fails to load, throw a nif loading error as is common for nif modules.\r\n\r\nTo avoid another case of a possible infinite retry from of `badarg` generated from by max depth, and/or an actual bad ejson term, use a specific `max_depth` error so we don't have to guess when we catch it and retry term traversal in erlang.\r\n\r\nThere was another undocumented case when badarg was thrown besides max depth or an invalid arg. It was when a prop value was compared with any other supported type. In erlang it would be handled in these\r\nclauses:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   less_erl({A},{B}) when is_list(A), is_list(B) -> less_props(A,B);\r\n   less_erl({A},_) when is_list(A)               -> -1;\r\n   less_erl(_,{B}) when is_list(B)               -> 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in C we threw a badarg for the last two clauses and relied on erlang to do all the work. This case was a potential performance issue as well since that is a common comparison for mango where we may compare keys against the max json object value (`<<255,255,255,255>>`), now all that happens in C without jumping back out into erlang.\r\n\r\nAdd a few property tests in order to validate collation behavior. The two main ones are:\r\n\r\n  1) Given an expected sort order of some test values, assert that both the erlang and nif collators would correctly order any of those test values.\r\n\r\n  2) In general, the nif collator would sort any json the same way as the erlang one.","created_at":"2021-09-11T06:32:56Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T19:17:50Z","closed_at":"2021-10-15T19:17:47Z","merged_at":"2021-10-15T19:17:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f704b48c8868c855ed0d3ef65ba303de816c24a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/28f26f52fe2e170d98658311dafa8198d96b8061","head":{"label":"apache:remove-couch-icu-driver","ref":"remove-couch-icu-driver","sha":"28f26f52fe2e170d98658311dafa8198d96b8061","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

and\r\nstreamlines the configuration with the existing Fauxton CSP options.\r\n\r\nDeprecates the old `[csp] enable` and `[csp] header_value` config\r\noptions, but they are honoured going forward.\r\n\r\nThey are replaced with `[csp] utils_enable` and `[csp] utils_header_value`\r\nrespectively. The functionality and default values remain the same.\r\n\r\nIn addition, these new config options are added, along with their\r\ndefault values:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[csp]\r\nattachments_enable = false\r\nattachments_header_value = sandbox\r\nshowlist_enable = false\r\nshowlist_header_value = sandbox\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, these add `Content-Security-Policy` headers to all attachment\r\nrequests and to all non-JSON show and all list function responses.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Nick Vatamaniuc <vatamane@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Robert Newson

if the source db purge sequence > `purge_infos_limit`, shard splitting would crash with the `{{invalid_start_purge_seq,0}, [{couch_bt_engine,fold_purge_infos,5...` error. That was because purge sequences were always copied starting from 0. That would only work as long as the total number of purges stayed below the purge_infos_limit threshold. In order to correctly gather the purge sequences, the start sequence must be based off of the actual oldest sequence currently available.\r\n\r\nAn example of how it should be done is in the `mem_rpc` module, when [loading purge infos](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/4ea9f1ea1a2078162d0e281948b56469228af3f7/src/mem3/src/mem3_rpc.erl#L206-L207), so here we do exactly the same. The `MinSeq - 1` logic is also evident by inspecting the [fold_purge_infos](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/couch/src/couch_bt_engine.erl#L625-L637) function.\r\n\r\nThe test sets up the exact scenario as described above: reduces the purge info limit to 10 then purges 20 documents. By purging more than the limit, we ensure the starting sequence is now != 0. However, the purge sequence btree is actually trimmed down during compaction. That is why there are a few extra helper functions to ensure compaction runs and finishes before shard splitting starts.\r\n\r\nFixes:

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

This improves the robustness of those tests by either increasing the timeout, in the case of active tasks tests, or by separating the monolithic \"bad config\" test into several smaller tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit

users with low {Q, N} dbs often got the `\"No DB shards could be opened.\"` error when the cluster is overloaded. The hard-coded 100 msec timeout was too low to open the few available shards and the whole request would crash with a 500 error.\r\n\r\nAttempt to calculate an optimal timeout value based on the number of shards and the max fabric request timeout limit.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of doubling (by default) timeouts forms a geometric progression. Use the well known closed form formula for the sum [0], and the maximum request timeout, to calculate the initial timeout. The test case illustrates a few examples with some default Q and N values.\r\n\r\nBecause we don't want the timeout value to be too low, since it takes time to open shards, and we don't want to quickly cycle through a few initial shards and discard the results, the minimum initial timeout is clipped to the\r\npreviously hard-coded 100 msec timeout. Unlike previously however, this minimum value can now also be configured.\r\n\r\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series\r\n\r\nFixes:

including a payload within a DELETE request is not forbidden by [RFC7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5) its presence on a delete attachment request leaves a mochiweb's acceptor in a semi-opened state since mochiweb's using lazy load for the request bodies.\r\nThis makes _a next_ immediate request to the same acceptor to hung until the previous request's receive timeout.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a step to explicitly \"drain\" and discard an entity body on a delete attachment request to prevent that.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIsolated test:\r\n\r\n`make elixir tests=test/elixir/test/attachments_test.exs:127`\r\n\r\nor manual test described in related issue\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nCloses #3692 \r\n\r\n##

shards are moved to new nodes, and the user supplies a change sequence from the old shard map configuration, attempt to match missing nodes and ranges by inspecting current shard uuids in order to avoid rewinds.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if a node and range was missing, we randomly picked a node in the appropriate range, so 1/3 of the time we might have hit the exact node, but 2/3 of the time we would end up with a complete changes feed rewind to 0.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this involves a fabric worker scatter gather operation to all shard copies. This should only happen when we get an old sequence. We rely on that happening rarely, mostly right after the shards moved, then users would get new sequence from the recent shard

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nDocumentation for design doc update functions specifies that permitted\r\nmethods are:\r\n\r\n    POST /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_update/{func}\r\n    PUT /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_update/{func}/{docid} [2]\r\n\r\nBut currently anything is accepted, even bogus methods such as in the\r\nfollowing example work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -v -u adm localhost:15984/db-1/_design/ddoc/_update/change -X BOGUS\r\n\r\n> BOGUS /db-1/_design/bar/_update/change HTTP/1.1\r\n>\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< content-length: 11\r\n< content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n<\r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\nEmpty World* Closing connection 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nA strict reading of the docs indicates that the null document endpoint\r\nonly allows POST [1] while the endpoint taking a document id only\r\nallows PUT [2]. However, the examples in both cases exclusively use\r\nPOST, and also PUT doesn't make as much sense from a semantic\r\nperspective since a new resource isn't being created, I assume the PUT\r\n is a typo, and both should be changed to POST.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the inconsistent usage even in CouchDB's own test\r\nsuite, it seems prudent to minimize incompatibility, while still\r\nimposing reasonable restrictions, and allow either PUT or POST for\r\nboth endpoints.\r\n\r\n[1] https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/ddoc/render.html#post--db-_design-ddoc-_update-func\r\n[2]

Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!--

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently CouchDB encodes '+' into ' ' in non-query parts of URLs. This is against CouchDB standards. See the original issue [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-883).\r\n\r\nNote: This is an opt-in policy for 3.x.\r\n\r\n###  Backward Incompatibility\r\nSince changing the way that '+' is encoded is a breaking change, there is a backward incompatibility issue with 3.x. For example, prior to this change if a user had created a document named `my doc`, they would have used an HTTP request similar to `% curl -X PUT http://localhost:15984/mydb/my+doc -H\"Authorization: Basic YWRtOnBhc3M=\"` and the `my+doc` would have been encoded into `my doc`. However, with this change, `my+doc` would be encoded into `my+doc`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nA test case has been added to test creating a document whose id contains a '+' with `encode_plus = true` and another test case has been added to test creating a document whose id contains a '+' with `encode_plus = false`. Furthermore, a test case has been added to test creating a dbname with '+' and `%2B` with `encode_plus = true`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmix test test/elixir/test/basics_test.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- Replication of attachments fails when the attachment name contains a +: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3239\r\n- Non-standard treatment of + character in URLs: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2235\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a fixup for pr https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3685\r\n\r\n(Using a separate PR as can't push to contributor's private fork)\r\n\r\nWhich fixed a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3673\r\n\r\nThe behavior we are trying to preserve is:\r\n```\r\n DELETE with a bad rev or without a rev of an existing doc and attachment should return a 409\r\n DELETE with a non-existent attachment name should return a 404\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe get_attachment handler was shifted to the left an indentation level, so make it easier to view the diff, switch to \"Hide whitespace changes\" in the diff option.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n make && make elixir tests=test/elixir/test/attachments_test.exs\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Couchdb on fdb, we want all javascript and language specific functionality to run through `couch_eval`. \r\nThis moves the `validate_doc_update` check to run through `couch_eval` instead of going

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis is a follow-up PR to https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3568 . The motivation is https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3568#issuecomment-853943222 . Since erlfmt ensures semantics don't change on formatting _and_ we've verified the `beam`s are okay, it's safe to assume we can run the formatter on all files internal to this repo and we probably don't need the `beam` checks anymore.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nAll but 2 files formatted are test files. Tests should run the same as previously. There are 2 additional files changed; I've checked them manually.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3568\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently CouchDB encodes '+' into ' ' in non-query parts of URLs. This is against CouchDB standards. See the original issue [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-883).\r\n\r\nNote: This is an opt-out policy for main.\r\n\r\n###  Backward Incompatibility\r\nSince changing the way that '+' is encoded is a breaking change, there is a backward incompatibility issue with 3.x. For example, prior to this change if a user had created a document named `my doc`, they would have used an HTTP request similar to `% curl -X PUT http://localhost:15984/mydb/my+doc -H\"Authorization: Basic YWRtOnBhc3M=\"` and the `my+doc` would have been encoded into `my doc`. However, with this change, `my+doc` would be encoded into `my+doc`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nA test case has been added to test creating a document whose id contains a '+' with `encode_plus = true` and another test case has been added to test creating a document whose id contains a '+' with `encode_plus = false`. Furthermore, a test case has been added to test creating a dbname with '+' and `%2B` with `encode_plus = true`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmix test test/elixir/test/basics_test.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- Replication of attachments fails when the attachment name contains a +: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3239\r\n- Non-standard treatment of + character in URLs: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2235\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

However, according to [HTTP Authentication RFC2617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-1.2), it should be case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThree test cases have been added to use different cases of \"Basic\" including \"basic\", \"BASIC\", and \"BAsIc\". Furthermore, you can execute the following curl requests and see that you will receive an appropriate response each time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n% curl http://localhost:15984/db1 -X PUT -H'Authorization: basic YWRtOnBhc3M='\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n% curl http://localhost:15984/db2 -X PUT -H'Authorization: Basic YWRtOnBhc3M='\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n% curl http://localhost:15984/db -X GET -H'Authorization: BASIC YWRtOnBhc3M='\r\n{\"cluster\":{\"n\":0,\"q\":0,\"r\":0,\"w\":0},\"compact_running\":false,\"data_size\":0,\"db_name\":\"db\",\"disk_format_version\":0,\"disk_size\":0,\"instance_start_time\":\"0\",\"purge_seq\":0,\"encryption\":{\"enabled\":false,\"key_manager\":{}},\"update_seq\":\"0000000a1f123cb400000000\",\"uuid\":\"00974c2f618fc85a3baede507945551b\",\"doc_del_count\":0,\"doc_count\":102,\"sizes\":{\"external\":98233562,\"views\":0}}\r\n% curl http://localhost:15984/db -X GET -H'Authorization: bAsIc YWRtOnBhc3M='\r\n{\"cluster\":{\"n\":0,\"q\":0,\"r\":0,\"w\":0},\"compact_running\":false,\"data_size\":0,\"db_name\":\"db\",\"disk_format_version\":0,\"disk_size\":0,\"instance_start_time\":\"0\",\"purge_seq\":0,\"encryption\":{\"enabled\":false,\"key_manager\":{}},\"update_seq\":\"0000000a1f123cb400000000\",\"uuid\":\"00974c2f618fc85a3baede507945551b\",\"doc_del_count\":0,\"doc_count\":102,\"sizes\":{\"external\":98233562,\"views\":0}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore, you would receive responses like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl http://localhost:15984/test1 -X PUT -H'Authorization: basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='\r\n{\"error\":\"unauthorized\",\"reason\":\"You are not a server admin.\"}\r\n\r\n$ curl http://localhost:15984/test1 -X PUT -H'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n\r\n $ curl http://localhost:15984/test1 -X GET -H'Authorization: BASIC YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='\r\n{\"error\":\"unauthorized\",\"reason\":\"You are not authorized to access this db.\"}\r\n\r\n # curl http://localhost:15984/test1 -X GET -H'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='\r\n{\"db_name\":\"test1\", ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThe authorization scheme for HTTP Basic Authentication should not be case sensitive:

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is to address the shortcomings detailed in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3631.\r\n\r\nThis exports the `mem3_utils` library for merging db creation options lists, and then ensures that anytime a shard is created it fetches the existing db configuration to do so.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issues described in `mem3_shards.erl`, `fabric_util.erl`, and `dreyfus_rpc.erl`.\r\n\r\nThis PR does _not_ address adding partition database creations options on the 5986 interface for `couch_httpd_db.erl`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nNot sure what the best way to test this is other than running the test suite. I had originally planned on adding tests first, but constructing the test system for these tests is quite tricky to do. Maybe someone else has a nice idea on that front.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently the `max_document_size`, `binary_chunk_size`, `max_attachment_size`, and `max_document_id_length` parameters can exceed the [limits of FDB](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/known-limitations.html). This PR checks these parameters against hardcoded limits to ensure that the limits of FDB are not exceeded.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nChange the parameters to integers above the hardcoded limits:\r\n\r\n- Greater than 8000000 bytes for `max_document_size`\r\n- Greater than 96000 bytes for `binary_chunk_size`\r\n- Greater than 8000000 bytes for `max_attachment_size`\r\n- Greater than 512 bytes for `max_document_id_length`\r\n\r\nThen, add log statements to ensure that the limits are not exceeded. That is, `max_document_size` should remain at 8000000 bytes or below, `binary_chunk_size` should remain at 96000 bytes or below, `max_attachment_size` should remain at 8000000 bytes or below, and `max_document_id_length` should remain at 512 bytes or below.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the responses returned should no longer contain the FDB `2103` or `2101` status codes. Each transaction that exceeds the limits should return the response `413 {\"error\":\"document_too_large\", \"reason\":\"<DocID>\"}`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nMax document size check is inaccurate: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3354\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `enc` (https://github.com/davisp/erlang-native-compiler) binary is kept in the `couchdb-jiffy` repository. This is a security risk. This PR builds the `enc` binary at the top level so we can verify where it came from and have it available for dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nFollow the steps to build CouchDB. After `./configure` is run, an `enc` binary should be located in `/bin`. Following the rest of the steps should lead to a successful build.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nRemove `enc` from `couchdb-jiffy` and build it at top-level CouchDB instead: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-jiffy/pull/5\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

is a port of commit ecd266b0e87f44e1080cabdb4c28e4758f5a4406 from 3.x to main. Including the same commit message from there for completeness below. Then, towards the end, there is a description of changes required to port this PR to main.\r\n\r\nPreviously, there were two ways to pass in basic auth credentials for endpoints -- using URL's userinfo part, and encoding them in an `\"Authorization\": \"basic...\"` header. Neither one is ideal for these reasons:\r\n\r\n * Passwords in userinfo don't allow using \":\", \"@\" and other characters. However, even after switching to always unquoting them like we did recently [1], it could break authentication for usernames or passwords previously\r\n   containing \"+\" or \"%HH\" patterns, as \"+\" might now be decoded to a \" \".\r\n\r\n * Base64 encoded headers need an extra step to encode them. Also, quite often  these encoded headers are confused as being \"encrypted\" and shared in a clear channel.\r\n\r\nTo improve this, revert the recent commit to unquote URL userinfo parts to restore backwards compatibility, and introduce a way to pass in basic auth credentials in the \"auth\" object. The \"auth\" object was already added a while\r\nback to allow authentication plugins to store their credentials in it. The format is:\r\n```\r\n   \"source\": {\r\n       \"url\": \"https://host/db\",\r\n       \"auth\": {\r\n           \"basic\": {\r\n               \"username\":\"myuser\",\r\n               \"password\":\"mypassword\"\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n{\"auth\" : \"basic\" : {...}} object is checked first, and if credentials are provided, they will be used. If they are not then userinfo and basic auth header will be parsed.\r\n\r\nInternally, there was a good amount duplication related to parsing credentials from userinfo and headers in replication ID generation logic and in the auth session plugin. As a cleanup, consolidate that logic in the `couch_replicator_parse` module.\r\n\r\nThe commit is quite different from the 3.x one for these two reasons:\r\n\r\n * `main` uses two types of replication endpoint \"objects\": `#httpdb` records and `HttpDb` maps. In most cases it uses maps which can be serialized and deserialized to and from json. But in lower level, connection handling code\r\n   in couch_replicator_httpc, it uses `#httpdb` records. This explain the need to still handle both representations. Auth session plugin, for instance, uses the lower level #httpdb records while replicator ID handling code uses the map based one.\r\n\r\n * `main` has all the parsing of replication documents and `_replicate` request bodies in a separate `couch_replicator_parse`. So, most of the code which handles normalizing basic auth creds is there instead of   `couch_replicator_docs` or `couch_replicator_utils` like it is in 3.x\r\n\r\nThanks to @jaydoane for the original idea for this scheme","created_at":"2021-06-03T18:32:57Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T03:22:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-04T03:22:05Z","merged_at":"2021-06-04T03:22:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"1860ebbf2fa1731a62f3c9b107b2e52811489c1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/787e35b5de45b9a2e9d519d2b5864c59fe7d5689","head":{"label":"apache:improve-basic-auth-creds-passing-in-replicator-main","ref":"improve-basic-auth-creds-passing-in-replicator-main","sha":"787e35b5de45b9a2e9d519d2b5864c59fe7d5689","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

there were two ways to pass in basic auth credentials for\r\nendpoints -- using URL's userinfo part and encoding the them in an\r\n`\"Authorization\": \"basic ...\"` header. Neither one is ideal for these reasons:\r\n\r\n * Passwords in userinfo doesn't allow using \":\", \"@\" and other characters.\r\n   However, even after switching to always unquoting them like we did recently\r\n   [1], would break authentication for usernames or passwords previously\r\n   containing \"+\" or \"%HH\" patterns, as \"+\" might now be decoded to a \" \".\r\n\r\n * Base64 encoded headers need an extra step to encode them. Also, quite often\r\n   these encoded headers are confused as being \"encrypted\" and shared in a\r\n   clear channel.\r\n\r\nTo improve this, revert the recent commit to unquote URL userinfo parts to\r\nrestore backwards compatibility, and introduce a way to pass in basic auth\r\ncredentials in the \"auth\" object. The \"auth\" object was already added a while\r\nback to allow authentication plugins to store their credentials in it. The\r\nformat is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   \"source\": {\r\n       \"url\": \"https://host/db\",\r\n       \"auth\": {\r\n           \"basic\": {\r\n               \"username\":\"myuser\",\r\n               \"password\":\"mypassword\"\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n{\"auth\" : \"basic\" : {...}} object is checked first, and if credentials are\r\nprovided, they will be used. If they are not then userinfo and basic auth\r\nheader will be parsed.\r\n\r\nInternally, there was a good amount duplication related to parsing credentials\r\nfrom userinfo and headers in replication ID generation logic and in the auth\r\nsession plugin. As a cleanup, consolidate that logic in the\r\n`couch_replicator_utils` module.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/f672b911db19981a81d7fc6ce8ac33b150234fd7\r\n\r\nThe original idea for this scheme belongs to @jaydoane\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.
