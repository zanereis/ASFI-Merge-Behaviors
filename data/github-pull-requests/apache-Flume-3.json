hope to confirm the following questions:\r\n      When I use execSource to get data to elasticsearchSink:\r\n      The source uses the \"GBK\" encoding, and the data on the es side will be

code configuration. So I made the following changes to execSource.java in my personal use:\r\n        eventList.add(EventBuilder.withBody(line.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")));\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------英文表达不清楚的话，以下是汉语原文\r\n我在使用execSource获取数据到elasticsearchSink时：\r\nsource使用“GBK”编码，es端的数据会乱码。\r\n我认为：\r\n
