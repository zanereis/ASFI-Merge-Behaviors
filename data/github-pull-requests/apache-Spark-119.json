What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the delegation token is fetched at the first time (see the `fetchDelegationTokens()` call at `HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider#getTokenRenewalInterval()`) the principal is the current user but at the subsequent token renewals (see `obtainDelegationTokens()` where `getTokenRenewer()` is used to identify the principal) are using a MapReduce/Yarn specific principal even on resource managers different from YARN.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `getTokenRenewer()` to use the current user instead of `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Master.getMasterPrincipal(hadoopConf)` when the resource manager is not YARN. \r\nThe condition `(master != null && master.contains(\"yarn\"))` is the very same what we already have in `hadoopFSsToAccess()`.\r\n\r\nI would like to say thank you for @squito who have done the investigation regarding of the problem which lead to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid `org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied.` for long running applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt will invalidate the bucket scan if add a cast to bucket column. In fact, sometimes we can avoid adding this cast if it is an equality expression and both sides are integral types.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new type coercion rule(`EqualityTypeCasts`) to support casting types according to bucket info for Equality expressions. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(l bigint) USING parquet CLUSTERED BY (l) INTO 200 buckets;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(dec decimal(18, 0)) USING parquet CLUSTERED BY (dec) INTO 200 buckets;\r\n\r\nSET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1;\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.l = t2.dec;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SortMergeJoin [cast(l#10L as decimal(20,0))], [cast(dec#11 as decimal(20,0))], Inner\r\n   :- Sort [cast(l#10L as decimal(20,0)) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(cast(l#10L as decimal(20,0)), 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=38]\r\n   :     +- Filter isnotnull(l#10L)\r\n   :        +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t1[l#10L]\r\n   +-

isnotnull(dec#11)\r\n            +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t2[dec#11]\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SortMergeJoin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs we know, `UnsafeRow` store one 8-byte word per field.\r\nCurrently, `UnsafeRow` supports read and store `CalendarInterval` with two int field and one long field. The two int field are `months` and `days` of `CalendarInterval`.\r\nSo `UnsafeRow` calls `putInt` of `Platform` twice and use two 8-byte word to store `months` and `days`.\r\nAfter my investigation, `getLong`/`putLong` of `Platform` have better performance than call `getInt`/`putInt` of `Platform` twice. Another side, if we can store `months` and `days` with one 8-byte word, we could save the memory too.\r\n\r\nThis PR combines two int field `months` and `days` of `CalendarInterval` to a long value. So we could call `getLong` or `putLong` once.\r\n\r\nThe micro benchmark before this PR show below.\r\n**Java 8**\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_311-b11 on Mac OS X

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Spark swallows the error thrown by catalog implementations, and re-throws a standard error. However, the original error from catalog implementations could be better and contain more internal information. It's better to still throw the original error.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new field `lookupError: Option[Throwable]` in `UnresolvedRelation` to hold the original error. We don't fail immediately as other rules (`ResolveSQLOnFile`) may be able to resolve it later. For all other cases, we can fail immediately with the original error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter error message\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR refectors constaint propagation using `TreeNode.multiTransform()`:\r\n- It improves the performance of `LogicalPlan.getAllValidConstraints()` because constraint pruning (based on the node output set) happens during the projection in `getAllValidConstraints()`.\r\n- Adds new `spark.sql.constraintPropagation.projectionLimit` and `spark.sql.constraintPropagation.inferenceLimit` configs to limit the number of constraints generated. These limits can be useful in some usecases where otherwise constraint propagation needs to be disabled entirelly (`spark.sql.constraintPropagation.enabled=false`) due to huge number of constraints.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprovement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-28T13:46:37Z","updated_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:38Z","closed_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c8ab6d02cf8ae3e25f91a5dafd09edaee4332f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38035/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38035/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38035/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d5bd577ced5a33c13b46c07ff3a7e3152a5127d","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-improve-constraint-generation","ref":"SPARK-improve-constraint-generation","sha":"8d5bd577ced5a33c13b46c07ff3a7e3152a5127d","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduce `TreeNode.multiTransform()` methods to be able to recursively transform a `TreeNode` (and so a tree) into multiple alternatives. These functions are particularly useful if we want to transform an expression with a projection in which subexpressions can be aliased with multiple different attributes.\r\n\r\nE.g. if we have a partitioning expression `HashPartitioning(a + b)` and we have a `Project` node that aliases `a` as `a1` and `a2` and `b` as `b1` and `b2` we can easily generate a stream of alternative transformations of the original partitioning:\r\n```\r\n// This is a simplified test, some arguments are missing to make it conciese\r\nval partitioning = HashPartitioning(Add(a, b))\r\nval aliases: Map[Expression, Seq[Attribute]] = ... // collect the alias map from project\r\nval s = partitioning.multiTransform {\r\n  case e: Expression if aliases.contains(e.canonicalized) => aliases(e.canonicalized)\r\n}\r\ns // Stream(HashPartitioning(Add(a1, b1)), HashPartitioning(Add(a1, b2)), HashPartitioning(Add(a2, b2)), HashPartitioning(Add(a2, b2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of `multiTransform` is a lazy stream to be able to limit the number of alternatives generated at the caller side as needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`TreeNode.multiTransform()` is a useful helper method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs are added.","created_at":"2022-09-28T13:20:50Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T13:20:54Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T12:58:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11f785e33d167adcff75a23a59a90e8d27fc6490","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60323c8de656643987ab648b42a341cbdc9c3ed7","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-40599-multitransform","ref":"SPARK-40599-multitransform","sha":"60323c8de656643987ab648b42a341cbdc9c3ed7","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the plotting functions working properly with pandas 1.5.0.\r\n\r\nThis includes two fixes:\r\n- Fix the `PandasOnSpark*Plot` to get name of plot in the string format properly.\r\n- Fix the default value of `subplots` parameter from `plot_frame` to match with latest pandas. (`None` -> `False`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### 1. get `_kind` from pandas class no longer possible.\r\n\r\nWe're leverage the pandas plotting classes to implement for `matplotlib` implementation, and get the class name from pandas like:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pandas.plotting._matplotlib.core import AreaPlot\r\n>>> AreaPlot._kind\r\n'area'\r\n```\r\nHowever, since pandas 1.5.0, they convert the member variable `_kind` into `@property`, so we cannot bring the name of class properly from pandas class as below:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pandas.plotting._matplotlib.core import AreaPlot\r\nAreaPlot._kind\r\n>>> AreaPlot._kind\r\n<property object at 0x7fe520d749a0>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. `subplots` parameter no longer allow the type other than `Iterable` or `bool`.\r\n\r\nWe internally set the default value for `subplots` as `None`, but from pandas 1.5.0 only allows `Iterable` or `bool`, so the plotting function is not work properly as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.plot(kind=\"bar\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: subplots should be a bool or an iterable\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this fixes, it work properly with pandas 1.5.0 as below:\r\n\r\n**<For Series and DataFrame plot>**\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"plotting.backend\", \"matplotlib\")\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psdf = ps.range(10)\r\n>>> psdf.plot(kind=\"bar\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nKeyError: 'bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"plotting.backend\", \"matplotlib\")\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psdf = ps.range(10)\r\n>>> psdf.plot(kind=\"bar\")\r\n<AxesSubplot:>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**<For DataFrame plot>**\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"plotting.backend\", \"matplotlib\")\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psdf = ps.range(10)\r\n>>> psdf.plot(kind=\"bar\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: subplots should be a bool or an iterable\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"plotting.backend\", \"matplotlib\")\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psdf = ps.range(10)\r\n>>> psdf.plot(kind=\"bar\")\r\n<AxesSubplot:>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip the `DataFrame.corr_with` test when the `other` is `pyspark.pandas.Series` and the `method` is \"spearman\" or \"pearson\", since there is regression in pandas 1.5.0 for that cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are some regressions in pandas 1.5.0, so we're not going to match the behavior for those cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested with pandas 1.5.0, confirmed the test pass.","created_at":"2022-09-28T11:01:31Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:46:12Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T01:46:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83a2fddc21a41222df8d7b39ba34a38a3c8fb738","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change populates `ExecutorDecommission` with messages in `ExecutorDecommissionInfo`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently the message in `ExecutorDecommission` is a fixed value (\"Executor decommission.\"), so it is the same for all cases, e.g. spot instance interruptions and auto-scaling down. With this change we can better differentiate those cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `CheckAnalysis`, we inline CTE relations first and then check the plan. This causes an issue if the CTE relation is not used, as the relation will be removed after inline. Then we will hit the last safeguard in `CheckAnalysis`:\r\n```\r\n    plan.foreachUp {\r\n      case o if !o.resolved =>\r\n        failAnalysis(s\"unresolved operator ${o.simpleString(SQLConf.get.maxToStringFields)}\")\r\n      case _ =>\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis produces pretty bad error messages.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR does an extra analysis check for CTE relations that are not used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate 100 compilation errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_12xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the case below, the left and the right are visiting the same table and its partitions, and both of them are ignoreCorruptFiles=true. The left side shows that a task skips partial of the data it reads because of encountering 'corrupt data', while the right read this file correctly. As ignoreCorruptFiles coarsely works with RuntimeException and IOException, it can not always represent a positive data corruption.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8326978/192667546-30d20739-a322-4618-8fb7-b0fa24301bcc.png)\r\n\r\nWhat's worse, such kinds of tasks are always marked as successful on the web UI. The same query visiting the same snapshot of data might result in inconsistency silently.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we make the ignoreCorruptFiles work with taskAttemptNumber together, that is, only the last attempt will ignore the maybe-corrupted file. Users may want fewer retries in case of performance regressions, so ignoreCorruptFilesAfterRetries is introduced which can be set to less than `spark.task.maxFailures`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix data loss.\r\n\r\nAlso, the UI now contains failed tasks for both positive and negative data corruption which helps us in bug hunting.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1467\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8326978/192730245-70cc04d0-6887-40bc-b2ce-01690502cae7.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's a bug fix (maybe a UI change like what I said above).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- packaged and tested locally,\r\n- new uts,\r\n- existing tests for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport `SELECT *` in an explicit way by connect proto.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent proto uses empty project list for `SELECT *`. However, this is an implicit way that it is hard to differentiate `not set` and `set but empty` (the latter is invalid plan). For longer term proto compatibility, we should always use explicit fields for passing through information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-27T22:13:08Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T05:00:24Z","closed_at":"2022-10-05T05:58:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c8f11c95bb7840e6dbc43c0f605781179ceb567","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c761866c4d37f53675ed47963db8d0440bffd188","head":{"label":"amaliujia:SPARK-40587","ref":"SPARK-40587","sha":"c761866c4d37f53675ed47963db8d0440bffd188","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR I propose a new session config:\r\nspark.sql.ansi.double_quoted_identifiers (true | false)\r\n\r\nWhen true the parser will interpret a double quoted string not as a string-literal, but - in compliance with ANSI SQL  - as an identifier.\r\nWe do this by splitting the double-quoted  literal from the STRING token, onto its own BACKQUOTED_STRING token in the lexer.\r\nin the grammar we replace all STRING references with a rule stringLit covering STRING and BACKQUOTED_STRING with the later being conditional on the config setting being false. (Note there already is a rule stringLiteral, hence the a tad quirky name).\r\n\r\nSimilarly quotedIdentifier is extended with BACKQUOTED_STRING conditional on the config being true.\r\n\r\nNote that this is NOT PERFECT.\r\nThe escape logic for strings (backslash) is different from that of identifiers (double-doublequotes).\r\nUnfortunately I do not know how to change this, since introducing a NEW token DOUBLE_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER has proven to break STRING - presumably due to the overlap in the pattern in the lexer.\r\n\r\nAt this point I consider this an edge-case. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nANSI requires quotation of identifiers to use double quotes. We have seen customer requests for support especially around column aliases. But it makes sense to have a holistic fix rather than a context specific application.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this is a new config introducing a new feature. It is not a breaking change, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\ndouble_quoted_identifiers.sql was added to sqltests\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-27T18:22:40Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T17:02:50Z","closed_at":"2022-10-04T23:12:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70570f9f7690bff0b6909b35ba5ae65a134874f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1731ef4cef979a6ad4ab56117ffb04d8906f059","head":{"label":"srielau:SPARK-40585-double-quoted-identifier","ref":"SPARK-40585-double-quoted-identifier","sha":"e1731ef4cef979a6ad4ab56117ffb04d8906f059","user":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":399207476,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTkyMDc0NzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"srielau/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srielau/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37407#discussion_r977818035, method `pyspark.sql.DataFrame.unpivot` should support only column names for `ids` and `values` arguments, to mirror PySpark `GroupedData.pivot`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify and align API with existing PySpark SQL methods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, modifies signature of `pyspark.sql.DataFrame.unpivot`, which has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests `unpivot` with non-string arguments.","created_at":"2022-09-27T13:03:34Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T17:12:03Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T12:24:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"458e20c8f61fc3eac322ed011770658b5b7c903c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a8dd4ad518adcc128f4127c7b7f1e1395b850211","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-pyspark-unpivot-column-names","ref":"branch-pyspark-unpivot-column-names","sha":"a8dd4ad518adcc128f4127c7b7f1e1395b850211","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update the docstring of `DataFrame.to_orc`, since `pandas.DataFrame.to_orc` is supported from pandas 1.5.0, but the behavior is a bit different.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFrom pandas 1.5.0, they support [writing the DataFrame to ORC files](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.5.0.html#writing-to-orc-files).\r\n\r\nIn pandas API on Spark, we already support this feature, but the behavior is different.\r\n\r\nSo, we should mention the difference in the documents.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, documentation update.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing doctest should pass.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-27T08:17:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:46:10Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:35:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcacfc60de035bc2efbf603b69a376e1a805034e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new test case for applyInPandasWithState to verify fault-tolerance semantic is not broken despite of random python worker failure. If the sink provides end-to-end exactly-once, the query should respect the guarantee. Otherwise, the query should respect stateful exactly-once, but at-least-once in terms of outputs.\r\n\r\nThe test leverages file stream sink which is end-to-end exactly-once, but to make the verification simpler, we just verify whether the stateful exactly-once is guaranteed despite of python worker failures.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis strengthen the test coverage, especially the fault-tolerance semantic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test added.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for DELETE commands for delta-based sources and implements the API added in PR #38004.\r\n\r\nSuppose there is a data source capable of encoding deletes using primary keys (`pk`). Also, this data source requires knowing the source file, which can be projected via a metadata column (`_file`), to encode deletes efficiently.\r\n\r\nAs an example, there will be a table with 1 file that contains 3 records. \r\n```\r\npk | salary | department\r\n------------------------\r\n1, 100, hr\r\n2, 50, software\r\n3, 150, hardware\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR would rewrite `DELETE FROM t WHERE salary <= 100` to perform the following steps:\r\n- find records that need to be removed by scanning the table with the delete condition;\r\n- project required columns to encode deletes (`pk` + `_file` in our case);\r\n- form a set of changes by adding a new column `__row_operation` column with value `delete`;\r\n- write the set of changes to the table using `WriteDeltaExec` and `DeltaWriter`;\r\n\r\nThe set of changes to encode for the DELETE statement above will look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n__row_operation | pk | _file\r\n----------------------------\r\ndelete, 1, file_a.parquet\r\ndelete, 2, file_a.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs opposed to group-based deletes that Spark already supports, the new logic will be able to discard records that did not change in the file that had matches (i.e. the record with `pk = 3` did not match the condition and was discarded).\r\n\r\nThen `WriteDeltaExec` will handle this set of changes and translate them into `delete()` calls on `DeltaWriter`. In the future, this logic will be extended to also cover UPDATEs and MERGEs by adding `update` and `insert` row operations to the set of changes supported by `WriteDeltaExec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThes changes are needed as per SPIP SPARK-35801.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrevent non-deterministic filters from being pushed to V2 file sources to match V1 file source and prevent certain issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPushing non-determinstic filters can cause exceptions (in the case of things that need to be initialized like `rand`), or different behavior than V1 in the case of using non-determinstic UDFs for collecting metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFixes some cases where queries could fail with filters involving functions like `rand`, and changes behavior to match V1 sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new legacy configuration to keep `grouping__id` value like the released Apache Spark 3.2 and 3.3.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this syntax is non-SQL standard and even Hive doesn't support it.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nhive> SELECT version();\r\nOK\r\n3.1.3 r4df4d75bf1e16fe0af75aad0b4179c34c07fc975\r\nTime taken: 0.111 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)\r\n\r\nhive> SELECT count(*), grouping__id from t GROUP BY a GROUPING SETS (b);\r\nFAILED: SemanticException 1:63 [Error 10213]:\r\nGrouping sets expression is not in GROUP BY key. Error encountered near token 'b'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-40218 fixed a bug caused by SPARK-34932 (at Apache Spark 3.2.0). As a side effect, `grouping__id` values are changed. \r\n\r\n- Apache Spark 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.0.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT count(*), grouping__id from (VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2)) AS t(k1,k2,v) GROUP BY k1 GROUPING SETS (k2) \").show()\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n|count(1)|grouping__id|\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n|       1|           1|\r\n|       1|           1|\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n- After SPARK-40218, Apache Spark 3.4.0, 3.3.1, 3.2.3\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT count(*), grouping__id from (VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2)) AS t(k1,k2,v) GROUP BY k1 GROUPING SETS (k2) \").show()\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n|count(1)|grouping__id|\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n|       1|           2|\r\n|       1|           2|\r\n+--------+------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n- This PR (Apache Spark 3.4.0, 3.3.1, 3.2.3)\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT count(*), grouping__id from (VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2)) AS t(k1,k2,v) GROUP BY

\r\n\r\nsql(\"SELECT count(*), grouping__id from (VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2)) AS t(k1,k2,v) GROUP BY k1 GROUPING SETS (k2)

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this simply added back the previous behavior by the legacy configuration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-26T09:28:15Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T16:24:58Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T09:14:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8e3efa04c16d4563f05407f850e1a71ef32b7db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4b622c22f7567396216c42d4fa120b2a510b929","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-40562","ref":"SPARK-40562","sha":"e4b622c22f7567396216c42d4fa120b2a510b929","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f2ba6b55c1d9ff2aea370e95db87bbcfc5164772","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate 100 compilation errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_11xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we allow only a specific pattern in bloom creation side plan (consecutive Filter/Project/Scan nodes) with added column pruning. This is fine when bloom was added due to a BroadcastHashJoin as exchange side would be small and we can do extra scan while creating bloom. \r\nBut when Bloom is introduced through SortMergeJoin (Shuffle Join) the exchange can be bigger, and extra scan and other operators can incur cost. In this case we can take advantage of reusing the whole Exchange while creating bloom. \r\nThis can further allow complex plans in bloom creation plan as there won't be extra cost of running them twice.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd Reusable exchange on Bloom creation side plan to improve query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nto clean the intermediate cached datasets created in `AttachDistributedSequenceExec`\r\n\r\n1. use `cache` instead of `checkpoint`/`localCheckpoint`: `checkpoint` need the checkpoint directory be specified via `sc.setCheckpointDir`, while `localCheckpoint` is not reliable;\r\n2. do not cache data in `AttachDistributedSequenceExec`, so that callers can `unpsersit` cached data if needed;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nin `argmax`, `argmin`, `searchsorted`, the intermediate RDDs are still cached after the job completed.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n   ...: s = ps.Series({'Corn Flakes': 100.0, 'Almond Delight': 110.0, 'Cinnamon Toast Crunch': 120.0, 'Cocoa Puff': 110.0})\r\n   ...: s.argmin()\r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: sc._jsc.getPersistentRDDs()\r\nOut[1]: {6: JavaObject id=o87}    \r\n\r\nIn [2]: s.argmin()\r\nOut[2]: 0\r\n\r\nOut[3]:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplement an approach to testing the proto to Scala conversion with a DSL according to the proposal in [spark-connect-testing-plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6EgS5vcmbwJUs5KGX4PzjKZVcSKd0qf0gLNZ6NFvOE/edit#bookmark=id.v673sn6dm9k4).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specifically, we need to decouple the testing for clients' data frame API and for the proto contract. The testing for proto is used to protect that any core changes in SQL does not break proto contracts. If necessary, a change in SQL plans has to justify that it should work with connect proto but does not need to cover clients (given that there could be many clients).  This DSL proposal is a part of that effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is still experimental and could face changes in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor testing the connect protobuf contract.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-26T05:53:06Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T02:59:49Z","closed_at":"2022-10-07T09:38:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"804d141e91a6ed252bae38789268550a77016626","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

mainly covered missing parts in the docstrings adding some more examples where it needed.\r\n\r\nI have also made all examples self explanatory by providing DataFrame creation command where it was missing for clarity to a user.\r\n\r\nThis should complete \"my take\" on `functions.py` docstrings & example improvements.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve PySpark

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.0.0-beta-4</h2>\n<h1>Version 3.0.0-beta-4</h1>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added a deterministic serialization API for C++. The deterministic\nserialization guarantees that given a binary, equal messages will be\nserialized to the same bytes. This allows applications like MapReduce to\ngroup equal messages based on the serialized bytes. The deterministic\nserialization is, however, NOT canonical across languages; it is also\nunstable across different builds with schema changes due to unknown fields.\nUsers who need canonical serialization, e.g. persistent storage in a\ncanonical form, fingerprinting, etc, should define their own\ncanonicalization specification and implement the serializer using reflection\nAPIs rather than relying on this API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added OneofOptions. You can now define custom options for oneof groups.</p>\n<pre><code>import &quot;google/protobuf/descriptor.proto&quot;;\nextend google.protobuf.OneofOptions {\n  optional int32 my_oneof_extension = 12345;\n}\nmessage Foo {\n  oneof oneof_group {\n    (my_oneof_extension) = 54321;\n    ...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>C++ (beta)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a deterministic serialization API in\nCodedOutputStream::SetSerializationDeterministic(bool). See the notes about\ndeterministic serialization in the General section.</li>\n<li>Added google::protobuf::Map::swap() to swap two map fields.</li>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak when calling Reflection::ReleaseMessage() on a message\nallocated on arena.</li>\n<li>Improved error reporting when parsing text format protos.</li>\n<li>JSON\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new parser option to ignore unknown fields when parsing JSON.</li>\n<li>Added convenient methods for message to/from JSON conversion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Various performance optimizations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Java (beta)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>File option &quot;java_generate_equals_and_hash&quot; is now deprecated. equals() and\nhashCode() methods are generated by default.</li>\n<li>Added a new JSON printer option &quot;omittingInsignificantWhitespace&quot; to produce\na more compact JSON output. The printer will pretty-print by default.</li>\n<li>Updated Java runtime to be compatible with 2.5.0/2.6.1 generated protos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Python (beta)</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen converting a native table metadata representation `CatalogTable` to `HiveTable` make sure bucket spec uses an existing column.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nHive metastore seems to be not case preserving with columns but case preserving with bucket spec, which means the following table creation:\r\n```\r\n  CREATE TABLE t(\r\n    c STRING,\r\n    B_C STRING\r\n  )\r\n  PARTITIONED BY (p_c STRING)\r\n  CLUSTERED BY (B_C) INTO 4 BUCKETS\r\n  STORED AS PARQUET\r\n```\r\nfollowed by a query:\r\n```\r\n  SELECT * FROM t\r\n```\r\nfails with:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Bucket columns B_C is not part of the table columns ([FieldSchema(name:c, type:string, comment:null), FieldSchema(name:b_c, type:string, comment:null)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate 100 compilation errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_10xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisErrorSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

SandishKumarHN(sanysandish@gmail.com) and Mohan Parthasarathy(mposdev21@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nProtocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It is widely used in Kafka-based data pipelines. Unlike Avro, Spark does not have native support for protobuf. This PR provides two new functions from_protobuf/to_protobuf to read and write Protobuf data within a data frame. \r\n\r\nThe implementation is closely modeled after Avro implementation so that it is easy to understand and review the changes. \r\n\r\nFollowing is an example of typical usage.\r\n \r\n```scala\r\n// `from_proto` requires absolute path of Protobuf schema file\r\n// and the protobuf message within the file\r\nval userProtoFile = \"./examples/src/main/resources/user.desc\"\r\nval userProtoMsg = \"User\"\r\n\r\nval df = spark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\r\n  .option(\"subscribe\", \"proto-topic-in\")\r\n  .load()\r\n\r\n// 1. Decode the Protobuf data into a struct;\r\n// 2. Filter by column `favorite_color`;\r\n// 3. Encode the column `name` in Protobuf format.\r\nval output = df\r\n  .select(from_protobuf('value, userProtoFile, userProtoMsg) as 'user)\r\n  .where(\"user.favorite_color == \\\"red\\\"\")\r\n  .select(to_protobuf($\"user.name\", userProtoFile, userProtoMsg) as 'value)\r\n\r\nval query = output\r\n  .writeStream\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\r\n  .option(\"topic\", \"proto-topic-out\")\r\n  .start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new functions are very similar to Avro\r\n\r\n- from_protobuf requires the proto descriptor file and the message type within that file which is similar to from_avro requiring the JSON schema.\r\n- to_protobuf is similar to to_avro and does not require the proto descriptor file as it can build the schema (protobuf descriptor) from the catalyst types. Similarly, to_proto (like to_avro) can also take in the descriptor file for describing the schema\r\n\r\n## What is supported\r\n\r\n- Protobuf format proto3 is supported ( Even though proto2 and proto3 are inter-operable, we have explicitly tested only with proto3)\r\n- Google protobuf supported types\r\n    - Scalar value types\r\n    - Enumerations\r\n    - Message types as field types\r\n    - Nested Messages\r\n    - Maps\r\n    - Unknown fields are well-formed protocol buffer serialized data representing fields that the parser does not recognize. Original version of proto3 did not include this when there are parsing problems. This feature is needed to detect schemas that does not match the message type and needed to support FAIL_SAFE and PERMISSIVE mode. This feature is available in proto3 with version. 3.5 onwards\r\n\r\n## What is not supported\r\n\r\n- Any requires the knowledge of the underlying object type when deserializing the message and generally not considered type safe\r\n- OneOf requires the knowledge of the object type that was encoded when deserializing the message\r\n- Custom Options is an advanced feature within protobuf where the users can define their own options\r\n- Catalyst types that are not natively supported in protobuf. This happens normally during serialization and an exception will be thrown when following types are encountered\r\n    - DecimalType\r\n    - DateType\r\n    - TimestampType\r\n\r\n## Test cases covered\r\n\r\nTests have been written to test at different levels\r\n\r\n- from_protobuf / to_protobuf (ProtoFunctionSuite)\r\n- ProtoToCatalyst / CatalystToProto (ProtoCatalystDataConversionSuite)\r\n- ProtoDeserializer / ProtoSerializer (ProtoSerdeSuite)\r\n\r\n### ProtoFunctionSuite\r\n\r\nA bunch of roundtrip tests go through to_protobuf(from_proto) or from_protobuf(to_proto) and compare the results. It also repeats some of the tests where to_protobuf is called without a descriptor file where the protobuf descriptor is built from the catalyst types.\r\n\r\n- roundtrip in to_protobuf and from_protobuf for struct for protobuf scalar types\r\n- roundtrip in to_protobuf(without descriptor params) and from_proto - struct for protobuf scalar types\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Repeated protobuf types\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Repeated Message Once\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Repeated Message Twice\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Map\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Enum\r\n- roundtrip in from_protobuf and to_protobuf - Multiple Message\r\n- roundtrip in to_protobuf and from_protobuf - with null\r\n\r\n### ProtoSerdeSuite\r\n\r\n- Test basic conversion - serialize(deserialize(message)) == message\r\n- Fail to convert with field type mismatch - Make sure the right exception is thrown for incompatible schema for serializer and deserializer\r\n- Fail to convert with missing nested Protobuf fields\r\n- Fail to convert with deeply nested field type mismatch\r\n- Fail to convert with missing Catalyst fields\r\n\r\n### ****ProtoCatalystDataConversionSuite****\r\n\r\n- ProtoToCatalyst(to_protobuf(basic_catalyst_types )): Boolean,Integer,Double,Float,Binary,String,Byte,Shost\r\n- Handle unsupported input of Message type: Serialize a message first and deserialize using a bad schema. Test with FAILFAST to get an exception and PERMISSIVE to get a null row\r\n- filter push-down to proto deserializer: Filtering the rows based on the filter during proto deserialization\r\n- Test ProtoDeserializer with binary message type\r\n\r\n### ****Cluster Testing****\r\nRecent(10-04-2022) changes have been tested with the configurations listed below.\r\nJob: Kafka + Spark Structure Streaming\r\n2 executors, each with 2048m and 2 cores\r\n150-200 events/second each event having 100 fields(basic types, message, map type, enum)\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-22T17:26:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T16:51:50Z","closed_at":"2022-10-12T02:45:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed7f62d751b5b1a3a2867fc9b0a13943410562d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/330d01e6ce9e4362ef8c12bef7f6f6f12d60b470","head":{"label":"SandishKumarHN:SPARK_PROTO_1","ref":"SPARK_PROTO_1","sha":"330d01e6ce9e4362ef8c12bef7f6f6f12d60b470","user":{"login":"SandishKumarHN","id":3078999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN","html_url":"https://github.com/SandishKumarHN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":523817313,"node_id":"R_kgDOHzjRYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"SandishKumarHN/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SandishKumarHN","id":3078999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN","html_url":"https://github.com/SandishKumarHN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SandishKumarHN/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent Word2Vec implementation has limits on the maximum model size and loses accuracy when scaled. There are no such problems in my implementation.\r\nAdvantages of my implementation:\r\n1. The most popular word2vec algorithm: skip-gram with negative sampling.\r\n2. No accuracy degradation as the number of partitions increases.\r\n3. No model size limitations. Vocab size(instead of vocab_size x vector_size) is limited by maximum integer number, but it can be easy solved by changing to long internal id. This limitation is critical when we can't effectively limit the vocab by min_count. The example of such task is node2vec.\r\n4. Better accuracy on downstream tasks. (see Comparison section)\r\n5. Multithreading support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nJavaSkipGramSuite has been added. I also plan to compare performance and accuracy on a public dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New implementation description\r\nSuppose the number of partitions is set to **K**. Each epoch is divided in the **K** subiterations. Each subiteration is divided into three stages:\r\n1. Randomly assign word embeddings to partitions by hashing with salt corresponding to current subiteration.\r\n2. Generate train pairs. Assign pairs to partitions by hashing with salt the central word as in the first step. Pairs with different central and context word partitions are dropped.\r\n3. Process each partition by in-memory skip-gram algorithm. Negative samples are taken within the partition.\r\n\r\nThe probability to keep pair in the second stage is 1/**K**. So after **K** iterations each train pair will be processed on average.\r\n\r\n#### Complexity\r\n1. `O(shuffle(|V| * dim))`.\r\n2. `O(read(|D|) + shuffle(|D| * 2 * w / K))`\r\n3. `O(read(|D| * 2 * w * n * dim / K)))`\r\n\r\n**|V|** is a vocab size, **dim** is a vector dimensionality, **|D|** is a dataset size, **n** is a number of negative samples, **w** is a widow size. **read** is processing data within partition, **shuffle** is data reshuffling.\r\n\r\n### Spark Word2Vec vs SkipGram comparison\r\nThe embedding training dataset is [First billion characters from wikipedia](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip).\r\nThe downstream task is [BBC News Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc).\r\n\r\nValidation protocol:\r\n1. Train embeddings on enwik9 dataset.\r\n5. Train GaussianNB classifier over word embeddings to classify news into topics.\r\n6. Evaluate classification model accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe validation script is [here](https://gist.github.com/EvgenyZamyatin/56bcea451d275dd2438a40f315faa8ca).\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n```\r\nmodel_type=Word2Vec\ttraining_time=4.985min\t    num_partitions=8\t    accuracy=0.41184 +/- 0.00435\r\nmodel_type=Word2Vec\ttraining_time=2.412min\t    num_partitions=16\t    accuracy=0.42184 +/- 0.00449\r\nmodel_type=Word2Vec\ttraining_time=1.619min\t    num_partitions=32\t    accuracy=0.41413 +/- 0.00428\r\nmodel_type=Word2Vec\ttraining_time=1.165min\t    num_partitions=64\t    accuracy=0.39551 +/- 0.00429\r\nmodel_type=Word2Vec\ttraining_time=1.242min\t    num_partitions=128\t    accuracy=0.39926 +/- 0.00406\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmodel_type=SkipGram\ttraining_time=4.753min      num_partitions=8\t    accuracy=0.48198 +/- 0.00441\r\nmodel_type=SkipGram\ttraining_time=4.305min      num_partitions=16\t    accuracy=0.51076 +/- 0.00402\r\nmodel_type=SkipGram\ttraining_time=6.319min      num_partitions=32\t    accuracy=0.50508 +/- 0.0043\r\nmodel_type=SkipGram\ttraining_time=10.656min     num_partitions=64\t    accuracy=0.50061 +/- 0.00447\r\nmodel_type=SkipGram\ttraining_time=21.951min     num_partitions=128\t    accuracy=0.50037 +/- 0.00402\r\n```\r\n**The best SkipGram's result outperforms the best Word2Vec's result by 20%.**\r\n\r\nYou can notice that unlike the standard implementation, SkipGram implementation does not accelerate monotonically with the growth of the number of partitions. The optimal number of partitions is not necessarily the maximum. It's because of asymptotic complexity of my solution:\r\n`K * (|D| + |D| * 2 * w * n * dim / K)`,\r\nwhere **K** is number of partitions, **|D|** is the dataset size, **w** is the window param, **n** is the negative samples param and **dim** is the vector size param. When we increase **K**, we increase time consuming for first term in the sum and decrease for the second.","created_at":"2022-09-22T09:02:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T00:17:31Z","closed_at":"2023-04-14T00:17:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ce2cbbd34613b6f5b741e562ea84d14008391b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a563a5f1e589d5bc71743ed2903b550e83c3dba0","head":{"label":"ezamyatin:master","ref":"master","sha":"a563a5f1e589d5bc71743ed2903b550e83c3dba0","user":{"login":"ezamyatin","id":8688087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODgwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8688087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin","html_url":"https://github.com/ezamyatin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezamyatin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8cf2b09caf71b4884543eff9023b196f97349811","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache",

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR improves field name resolution in `CreateStruct` when using `struct()` with fields from `named_struct` or `map` and makes \"index\" notation consistent with \"dot\" notation. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect struct(a['x'], a['y']), struct(a.x, a.y) from (select named_struct('x', 1, 'y', 2) as a) \r\n``` \r\n\r\nAs you can observe, the first struct has \"col1\" and \"col2\" names while the second struct has \"x\" and \"y\" which correspond to the parent struct fields.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nroot\r\n |-- struct(a.x, a.y): struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col2: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |-- struct(a.x, a.y): struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- x: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- y: integer (nullable = false)\r\n\r\n+----------------+----------------+\r\n|struct(a.x, a.y)|struct(a.x, a.y)|\r\n+----------------+----------------+\r\n|{1, 2}          |{1, 2}          |\r\n+----------------+----------------+ \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes those two examples consistent and both structs will have the following schema.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nroot\r\n |-- struct(a.x, a.y): struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- x: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- y: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |-- struct(a.x, a.y): struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- x: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- y: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMakes the behaviour consistent between `struct(a.x)` and `struct(a['x'])`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the column names returned by `struct()` function will be different after this patch.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests to verify the fix.","created_at":"2022-09-22T07:47:46Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T01:35:43Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T01:08:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"164ca9dd8902cbc04f705103e4a4a5a3e09497a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33c0033dafeff555075e3e7f26336efd097ea3cc","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-40527","ref":"SPARK-40527","sha":"33c0033dafeff555075e3e7f26336efd097ea3cc","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-17321, `YarnShuffleService` will persist data to local shuffle state db/reload data from local shuffle state db only when Yarn NodeManager start with `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED = true`.\r\n\r\n`YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` not set `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` and the default value of the configuration is false,  so `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` will neither trigger data persistence to the db nor verify the reload of data.\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to let `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` restart the verification of registeredExecFile reload scenarios, to achieve this goal, this pr make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new un-document configuration `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing` to `YarnShuffleService`, and Initialize `_recoveryPath` when `_recoveryPath == null && spark.yarn.shuffle.testing == true`.\r\n\r\n2. Only set `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing = true` in `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`, and add assertions to check `registeredExecFile` is not null to ensure that registeredExecFile reload scenarios will be verified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix registeredExecFile reload  test scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhy not test by configuring `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` as true?\r\n\r\nThis configuration has been tried\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 3.3.1**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite -Phadoop-3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYarnShuffleIntegrationSuite:\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/shaded/org/iq80/leveldb/DBException\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.initAndStartRecoveryStore(NodeManager.java:313)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.serviceInit(NodeManager.java:370)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$NodeManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:597)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.CompositeService.serviceInit(CompositeService.java:109)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:327)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.BaseYarnClusterSuite.beforeAll(BaseYarnClusterSuite.scala:105)\r\n  at org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll.liftedTree1$1(BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:212)\r\n  ...\r\n  Cause: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.shaded.org.iq80.leveldb.DBException\r\n  at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:387)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:419)\r\n  at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:352)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:352)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.initAndStartRecoveryStore(NodeManager.java:313)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.serviceInit(NodeManager.java:370)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$NodeManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:597)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.CompositeService.serviceInit(CompositeService.java:109)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 2.7.4**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite -Phadoop-2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYarnShuffleIntegrationSuite:\r\norg.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite *** ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot support recovery with an ephemeral server port.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-17321, `YarnShuffleService` will persist data to local shuffle state db/reload data from local shuffle state db only when Yarn NodeManager start with `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED = true`.\r\n\r\n`YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` not set `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` and the default value of the configuration is false,  so `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` will neither trigger data persistence to the db nor verify the reload of data.\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to let `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` restart the verification of registeredExecFile reload scenarios, to achieve this goal, this pr make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new un-document configuration `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing` to `YarnShuffleService`, and Initialize `_recoveryPath` when `_recoveryPath == null && spark.yarn.shuffle.testing == true`.\r\n\r\n2. Only set `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing = true` in `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`, and add assertions to check `registeredExecFile` is not null to ensure that registeredExecFile reload scenarios will be verified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix registeredExecFile reload  test scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhy not test by configuring `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` as true?\r\n\r\nThis configuration has been tried\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 3.3.2**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite -Phadoop-3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYarnShuffleIntegrationSuite:\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/shaded/org/iq80/leveldb/DBException\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.initAndStartRecoveryStore(NodeManager.java:313)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.serviceInit(NodeManager.java:370)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$NodeManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:597)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.CompositeService.serviceInit(CompositeService.java:109)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:327)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.BaseYarnClusterSuite.beforeAll(BaseYarnClusterSuite.scala:111)\r\n  at org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll.liftedTree1$1(BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:212)\r\n  ...\r\n  Cause: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.shaded.org.iq80.leveldb.DBException\r\n  at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:387)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:419)\r\n  at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:352)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:352)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.initAndStartRecoveryStore(NodeManager.java:313)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.serviceInit(NodeManager.java:370)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$NodeManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:597)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.service.CompositeService.serviceInit(CompositeService.java:109)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 2.7.4**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite -Phadoop-2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYarnShuffleIntegrationSuite:\r\norg.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite *** ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot support recovery with an ephemeral server port.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen running spark application against spark 3.3, I see the following :\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported data source V2 partitioning type: CustomPartitioning\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.V2ScanPartitioning$$anonfun$apply$1.applyOrElse(V2ScanPartitioning.scala:46)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.V2ScanPartitioning$$anonfun$apply$1.applyOrElse(V2ScanPartitioning.scala:34)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.$anonfun$transformDownWithPruning$1(TreeNode.scala:584)\r\n```\r\nThe CustomPartitioning works fine with Spark 3.2.1\r\nThis PR proposes to relax the code and treat all unknown partitioning the same way as that for UnknownPartitioning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n3.3.0 doesn't seem to warrant such behavioral change (from that of 3.2.1 release).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis would allow user's custom partitioning to continue to work with 3.3.x releases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test suite.\r\nI have run the test using Cassandra Spark connector and modified Spark (with this patch) which passes.","created_at":"2022-09-21T16:58:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T21:51:19Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T21:51:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"328c51173a81c7d04eefab43264208a9e07e072d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5b7bc3a892778736753a3b591ca8b86dd6dd15a","head":{"label":"tedyu:unk-33","ref":"unk-33","sha":"d5b7bc3a892778736753a3b591ca8b86dd6dd15a","user":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325822007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU4MjIwMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"tedyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark 3.4 support Python 3.7+ ,  but python related UTs only check  python executable exist, not check the python version. \r\n\r\nSo this pr make the relevant tests check whether the python  executable  version is greater than the minimum supported version.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTest  python related UTs only when the  minimum version support is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if the python runtime version is less than the minimum supported version, python related UTs will not execute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

code and treat all unknown partitioning the same way as that for `UnknownPartitioning`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n3.3.0 doesn't seem to warrant such behavioral change (from that of 3.2.1 release).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis would allow user's custom partitioning to continue to work with 3.3.x releases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test suite.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T16:21:03Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T16:56:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T16:41:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d38d0db77c5d4695c26ade138eeb9352ffa91284","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46f45ef3274a76b1c72420c1ba9cf4ac3b6c7a9f","head":{"label":"tedyu:v2-part-unk","ref":"v2-part-unk","sha":"46f45ef3274a76b1c72420c1ba9cf4ac3b6c7a9f","user":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325822007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU4MjIwMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"tedyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes application name in spark streaming metrics name.\r\nSpark  StreamingSource  Metrics sourceName is inappropriate.The label now looks like `application_xxxxx_xxxx_driver_NetworkWordCount_StreamingMetrics_streaming_lastCompletedBatch_processingEndTime `, instead of `application_xxxxx_xxxx_driver_StreamingMetrics_streaming_lastCompletedBatch_processingEndTime`, the Spark app name is not need.\r\nThis makes it hard to use metrics for different Spark applications over time. And this makes the metrics sourceName standard inconsistent\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRemoving the min heap setting is consistent with the settings for the YARN executor process and allows the JVM to reduce the heap when needed to reduce memory consumption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWe have this change deployed in our production environment to solve for OOM kills we were experiencing when running in K8S but were not seeing when running in
