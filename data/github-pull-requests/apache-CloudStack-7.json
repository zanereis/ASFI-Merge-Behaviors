Description\r\n\r\nThe `capacity` and `usage` values from secondary storage shown in the logs lack accuracy due to the absence of decimal places, creating cases where the value is rounded down even if it is close to the higher number (e.g., 49.90 GB being shown as 49GB).\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by adding two decimal places to `capacity` and `usage` values. Additionally, in order to standardize, the `threshold` value, which was more accurate than necessary, was reduced to only two decimal places.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by registering a template and verifying the logs.\r\n\r\nBefore changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-05-03T19:33:48,616 DEBUG [c.c.s.StatsCollector] (secstorage-1:[ctx-391b7254]) (logid:bcdb0d20) Verifying image storage [1].

Description\r\n\r\nThe global settings `*.smtp.useAuth` and `quota.usage.smtp.useStartTLS` are of boolean type, but the UI provides a standard text input field to manipulate them and does not perform any input validation. This PR, therefore, adds the toggle component to be rendered to manipulate these configurations.\r\n\r\nBesides that, the global settings `*.smtp.enabledSecurityProtocols` expect a white-space separated list of predefined values, but the UI also provides a text input field without any proper validation. As a consequence of that, this PR also adds a new component that enables operators to select and deselect values that belong to a list of predefined values.  \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Available options to be selected - <code>*.smtp.enabledSecurityProtocols</code></summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/115510880/c394e949-5b90-4815-ab3d-6191e54334a2)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Display of selected options - <code>*.smtp.enabledSecurityProtocols</code></summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/115510880/6287a1ec-ee2e-4095-908e-429e53d805e1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### Tests of `*.smtp.useAuth` and `quota.usage.smtp.useStartTLS`\r\n\r\n1. In order to test the boolean settings, I imagined a scenario prior to the proposed changes, in which the operator could change the settings' values without any validation.\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT name, value\r\nFROM `cloud`.`configuration`\r\nWHERE name IN (\"quota.usage.smtp.useAuth\", \"alert.smtp.useAuth\", \"project.smtp.useAuth\", \"quota.usage.smtp.useStartTLS\");\r\n```\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Query output:</summary>\r\n\r\n| name | value |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| alert.smtp.useAuth | on |\r\n| project.smtp.useAuth | TRUE |\r\n| quota.usage.smtp.useAuth | 1 |\r\n| quota.usage.smtp.useStartTLS | false |\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. I verified the source code and the values of these settings are retrieved through `BooleanUtils.toBoolean(String)`. It returns `true` if the value is `true`, `y`, `t`, `1`, `on` or `yes` (case-insensitive).\r\n\r\n    Hence, I executed the SQL query that has been added to the update script. The query converts the values that are interpreted as `true` to `true`. Values that are not interpreted as `true`, such as `false` and `0`, are converted to `false`. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Normalization output:</summary>\r\n\r\n| name | value |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| alert.smtp.useAuth | true |\r\n| project.smtp.useAuth | true |\r\n| quota.usage.smtp.useAuth | true |\r\n| quota.usage.smtp.useStartTLS | false |\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n3. After this, I manipulated the settings through UI and I checked that when the toggle component was on, the parameter `value` was sent to the API as `true`. When the toggle was off, on the other hand, the parameter was sent as `false`. \r\n\r\n#### Tests of `*.smtp.enabledSecurityProtocols`\r\n\r\n1. When the component is focused, all the available options are displayed to the operator.\r\n\r\n2. After selecting the desired options and confirming the update, the `value` parameter is sent to the API as a white-space separated list with the selected values.\r\n\r\n3. If no option is selected, `value` is sent as an empty string (`\"\"`).","created_at":"2024-05-02T15:04:50Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T07:54:18Z","closed_at":"2024-06-11T07:54:03Z","merged_at":"2024-06-11T07:54:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"1383625c93e300c6b8d62b52ddfd090d3291fc74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073882,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:config","name":"type:config","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30/labels","id":9577330,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AkiNy","number":30,"title":"4.20.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":245,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T09:42:31Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-11-27T14:52:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9031/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9031/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9031/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/89eb61dd00584344453ae897e24492b4727c348a","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-configurations-definitions","ref":"fix-configurations-definitions","sha":"89eb61dd00584344453ae897e24492b4727c348a","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.g

Description\r\n\r\nDocumentation PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/398\r\n\r\nCurrently, an administrator can break host tag compatibility for a VM administrator by certain operations:\r\n* deploy/start VM on a specific host\r\n* migrate VM\r\n* restore VM\r\n* scale VM\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the user to specify tags which must be checked during these operations.\r\n#### Global Settings\r\n1. `vm.strict.host.tags` - A comma-separated list of tags for strict host check (Default - empty)\r\n2. `vm.strict.resource.limit.host.tag.check` - Determines whether the resource limits tags are considered strict or not (Default - true)\r\n\r\nDuring the above operations, we now check and throw an error if host tags compatibility is being broken for tags specified in `vm.strict.host.tags`. If `vm.strict.resource.limit.host.tag.check` is set to `true`, tags set in `resource.limit.host.tags` are also checked during these operations.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nManually tested\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-30T16:44:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T10:13:57Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T09:12:17Z","merged_at":"2024-06-25T09:12:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6ceeab3b3ab5e75163387705bb3e1480999a100","assignee":{"login":"vladimirpetrov","id":12384665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12384665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirpetrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vladimirpetrov","id":12384665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12384665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirpetrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nBecause we have the condition that a powerflex/scaleio volume can be a size /8 the user can exploit this and request a smaller number without exceeding the limit, but eventually PF will deploy a volume of size [req-size ]< and /8, thus allowing the user to break the limit\r\n\r\n#### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n\r\n1. Set a tag limit of 6GB \r\n2. Deploy a volume with the offering of the tag limit and override the size to '5' \r\n3. Cloudstack will consider correctly that request is within the tag limit 5<6, but will eventually deploy a volume with 8 GB exceeding the limit\r\n4.

Description\r\nFeature spec: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Purge+Expunged+Resources\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the functionality of purging removed DB entries for CloudStack entities (currently only for VirtualMachine). There would be three mechanisms for purging removed resources:\r\n\r\n- Background task - CloudStack will run a background task which runs at a defined interval. Other parameters for this task can be controlled with new global settings.\r\n- API - New admin-only API `purgeExpungedResources`. It will allow passing the following parameters - `resourcetype`, `batchsize`, `startdate`, `enddate`. Currently, API is not supported in the UI.\r\n- Config for service offering. Service offerings can be created with `purgeresources` parameter which would allow purging resources immediately on expunge.\r\n\r\nFollowing new global settings have been added:\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.enabled`: Default: false. Whether to run a background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.resources`: Default: (empty). A comma-separated list of resource types that will be considered by the background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources. Currently only VirtualMachine is supported. An empty value will result in considering all resource types for purging.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.interval`: Default: 86400. Interval (in seconds) for the background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.delay`: Default: 300. Initial delay (in seconds) to start the background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources task.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.batch.size`: Default: 50. Batch size to be used during purging of the DB records of the expunged resources.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.start.time`: Default: (empty). Start time to be used by the background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources. Use format `yyyy-MM-dd` or `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`.\r\n- `expunged.resources.purge.keep.past.days`: Default: 30. The number of days in the past from the execution time of the background task to purge the DB records of the expunged resources for which the expunged resources must not be purged. To enable purging DB records of the expunged resource till the execution of the background task, set the value to zero.\r\n- `expunged.resource.purge.job.delay`: Default: 180. Delay (in seconds) to execute the purging of the DB records of an expunged resource initiated by the configuration in the offering. Minimum value should be 180 seconds and if a lower value is set then the minimum value will be used.\r\n\r\nDocumentation PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/397\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nAPI usage:\r\n```\r\n> purge expungedresources startdate=2024-04-15 enddate=2024-04-20 resourcetype=VirtualMachine\r\n{\r\n  \"purgeexpungedresourcesresponse\": {\r\n    \"resourcecount\": 6\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nVerified new smoke test,\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@pr8999-t6925-kvm-centos7-marvin marvin]# nosetests --with-xunit --xunit-file=results.xml --with-marvin --marvin-config=./pr8999-t6925-kvm-centos7-advanced-cfg -s -a tags=advanced --hypervisor=KVM tests/smoke/test_purge_expunged_vms.py\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py:32: CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team.

Changes behaviour of details param handling for:\r\n  - listVirtualMachines API: when the details param is not provided, it returns `all` details excluding/including `stats` which is controllable by a new global setting `list.vm.default.details.stats`\r\n  - listVirtualMachinesMetrics API: when the details param is not provided, it uses `all` details including `stats`\r\n- Users who are affected by the stats related change, can have backward compatibility at the higher-cost of listVirtualMachines API response time by setting `list.vm.default.details.stats` to true\r\n- Remove ConfigKey vm.stats.increment.metrics.in.memory which was renamed to `vm.stats.increment.metrics` in #5984 and also remove unused/unnecessary global settings via upgrade path\r\n- Changes default value of VM stats accumulation setting `vm.stats.increment.metrics` to false until a better solution emerges. Since #5984, this is true and during the execution of listVM APIs the stats are clubbed/calculated which can immensely slow down list VM API calls.\r\n- Fix UI that uses listVirtualMachinesMetrics to not call `stats` detail when in list view without metrics selected.\r\n\r\nThese changes see 2-4x gains in the listVirtualMachines APIs call and in the UI. For environment where code changes are not possible, disabling `vm.stats.increment.metrics` global setting saw 2-4x speed gain in the list API calls.\r\n\r\nKnown issues that led to this:\r\n- VM listing slowness can cause side-effects with integrations such as https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8975\r\n- Side-effects seen in UI and CAPC (while listing VMs) in users/prod environments\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [x] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested a workaround in a 4.18.2.0 env KVM based, with only 12 VMs:\r\n\r\n1. List VM API call without details and with details but global setting `vm.stats.increment.metrics` disabled:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1097\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 11 29 31 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/95203/67d134d9-71c6-4f9e-a159-18516786eb07\">\r\n\r\n2. List VM API call without detail and with detail and `vm.stats.increment.metrics` enabled:\r\n<img width=\"1067\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 11 31 15 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/95203/e8473829-e3c0-424a-ba46-7f863eae6272\">\r\n\r\n- We see ~3-4x gains by simply disabling the global setting\r\n- We see 15x gains when stats details isn't used but the global setting is enabled\r\n- We see 4x gains when stats detail isn't used and global setting is disabled\r\n\r\nWith this PR, I propose to change the earlier behaviour for listVirtualMachines API to exclude stats when details aren't provided. This can immensely speed up several integrations, who call listVMs APIs that not necessarily need `stats` in it.\r\nWhile, the listVirtualMachinesMetrics API was amended to retain old behaviour so when details aren't passed it could\r\nreturn all details including stats as expected. In the release notes likely we can mention about this, so folks who don't want accumulated stats can disable it but for new env we don't want to encourage this by default (as we already have the nice

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the below issue:\r\n1. Register two VM templates, small and large.\r\n2. Deploy VM using smaller template while overriding the rootdisksize\r\n3. Start VM if not started\r\n4. Stop VM\r\n5. Reinstall VM to larger VM template\r\n6. Observe new root is the size of old volume. This is happening because the `rootdisksize` detail for VM overrides the template's size.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For

Description\r\n\r\nAs reported in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8713#issuecomment-1969866705, the Storage section in the sidebar is not displayed to users when they do not have permission to the API `listVolumesMetrics`. However, roles can have permissions to other APIs, such as `listBackups` and `listSnapshots`, in which case the section should be displayed. This situation is not exclusive to the Storage section.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by changing how the routes are filtered. Now, sections will be shown if they have at least one visible child. For other routes, the previous logic is still applied.\r\n\r\nCloses #8730.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nHere's how the menu looks like before (left) and after the changes (right) for a user that does not have permission for `listVolumesMetrics`:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-04-25 10-50-04](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/25729641/2eef414e-15d4-4391-97a2-8f190a168906)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I created a role `v`, based on the role `User`, that had access to `listSnapshots` and `listBuckets`, but did not have to `listVolumesMetrics`;\r\n2. I created an account `v` using role `v`;\r\n3. I accessed the UI using account `v`;\r\n4. I verified that the Storage section was shown, having the Volume Snapshots and Buckets pages;\r\n5. I verified that the other sections did not change;\r\n6. I clicked the Storage section and verified that I was redirected to the Volume Snapshots page;\r\n7. I denied `listSnaphots` and `listBuckets` for role `v`;\r\n8.

introduces a MySQL innodb table based distributed lock which can be used by one or more management server and its threads. This removes usage of MySQL server provided locking functions (GET_LOCK, RELEASE_LOCK) which are not replicated or [not supported](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.0/limitation.html) currently by any MySQL clustering solutions. This would be the first main step in having CloudStack to work with a MySQL clustering solution such as InnoDB cluster, Percona Xtradb cluster, MariaDB galera cluster. There may be other changes required which can be found in due course if this feature works at scale.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local setup against simulator & mvn, in a single management server no exception were seen. Most tests need to be done such as:\r\n\r\n- simulator based smoketests which is one mvn-run of mgmt server + one mysql db server\r\n- smoketests (test matrix) which tests largely one mgmt server + one mysql db server\r\n- multiple (say 3) mgmt servers + one mysql db server\r\n- multiple (say 3) mgmt servers + mysql db cluster with say 3

Description\r\n\r\nUsing KVM as the hypervisor, when migrating a VM that has volumes on NFS storage, if any volume of it is migrated, all volumes that are on NFS must be migrated, otherwise, the migration will fail with the error `unable to execute QEMU command 'block- export-add': Block node is read-only`. \r\n\r\nThis situation occurs because, during the migration of VMs with volumes, the ACS does not inform which volumes should be migrated, causing Libvirt to assume that they will all be migrated, even if their path does not change, leading the hypervisor to try to overwrite the volumes of the VM during migration, resulting in the aforementioned error.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the migration API used so that ACS informs which volumes should be migrated.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ]

used for the tests below.\r\n\r\nBefore applying the changes, when migrating the VM and any of the volumes alone, the error `unable to execute QEMU command 'block-export-add': Block node is read-only` occurred.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the changes, it was possible to migrate both the root volume alone, and migrate just one of the datadisks. After each migration, a dump of the VM XML was performed and verified that only the correct volumes were migrated.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-19T17:59:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-07T12:33:57Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T07:35:25Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T07:35:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"cec6ade257ca231f7bb5a7062ee1ef0739b24e32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mlsorensen","id":1047709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BryanMLima","id":42067040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDY3MDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42067040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanMLima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073278,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:primary-storage","name":"component:primary-storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31/labels","id":9981290,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AmE1q","number":31,"title":"4.19.1.0","description":"issues

Description\r\n\r\nIn shared, isolated networks and vpcs in advanced zone, user vms can easily perform ip/arp/mac spoofing by pretending to be another vm in the same network.\r\n\r\n- change mac\r\n```\r\nip link set dev eth0 down\r\nip link set dev eth0 address <MAC of another vm>\r\nip link set dev eth0 up\r\n```\r\n- change IP\r\n```\r\nip addr add dev eth0 <IP/cidr of another vm in same network>\r\nip addr del dev eth0 <old IP/cidr>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- these can also be done by netplan/network-scripts configurations.\r\n\r\nlibvirt has a network traffic filtering subsystem which can be used to prevent spoofing. (https://libvirt.org/formatnwfilter.html#concepts)\r\n- It provides some pre-existing network filters (https://libvirt.org/formatnwfilter.html#pre-existing-network-filters), no-mac-spoofing is missed in the table. \r\n- Ideally we should use `clean-traffic`, however, the `IP/ARP anti-spoofing does not work` in our testing, as the IP is not specified in the libvirt vm definition XML by cloudstack.\r\n-  libvirt can auto-detect the IP but the auto-detected IP is not always correct, for example, when user configures (wrong) static IP inside the user VM.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `no-mac-spoofing` for each nic to prevent mac spoofing.\r\n\r\nIt could be an improvement PR to support all MAC/IP/ARP spoofing\r\n- it might lead to some overhead.\r\n- it is better to be configurable for guest network, network offering or account\r\n- IP/network information needs to be added to the InterfaceDef for each type of interface (bridge, direct, network, vhostuser, etc).\r\n- it might be not needed in advanced zone with security groups, as there are already iptables/ebtables/ipset rules to prevent the spoofings\r\n- it needs some discussion and testing. `clean-traffic` is good, but it might not be what we want. we need to evaluate the pre-existing network filters and probably consider creating customized filters. refer to

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the UI and CLI support through which NFS mount options can be specified for a primary storage on KVM hosts.\r\nThe mount options tested for this PR are **NFS version** and **nconnect**.\r\n\r\nMount options can be given while adding a Primary storage using the add Zone wizard. It can also be given from the Add Primary storage form. A new field `NFS mount options` is provided in the respective forms.\r\nMount options can be later modified also from the Primary Storage detail view via the `Edit Primary Storage` button.\r\n\r\nThe storage pool needs to be remounted on all the hosts for the new mount option to take affect. So, for a pre-existing storage pool, it has to be in maintenance mode for this functionality to be visible.\r\n\r\nNFS  mount options are saved in storage_pool_details table and the createStoragePool and updateStoragePool APIs takes the input as a details parameter.\r\n\r\n**A note on the nconnect option.**\r\n(https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP5/html/SLES-all/cha-nfs.html)\r\n\r\nThis option defines the count of TCP connections that the client makes to the NFS server. All the mounts from the same server on the client will have the same nconnect value and all mounts will share the same number of TCP connections.\r\n\r\nThe nconnect setting is applied only during the first mount process to the particular NFS server. If the same client executes the mount command to the same NFS server, all already established connections will be shared—no new connection will be established. To change the nconnect setting, you have to unmount all clients connections to the particular NFS server. Then you can define a new value of the nconnect option.\r\n\r\nSo, from CloudStack’s perspective also, the first storage pool created from a NFS server will set the nconnect setting on the hypervisor host corresponding to the server. Specifying a different nconnect mount option while creating a new storage pool from the same server will not change the nconnect setting on the host.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if there is only one pre-existing storage pool from a give NFS server mounted on the host, modifying the nconnect mount option via CloudStack will change the nconnect setting on that host.\r\nIf there are more than one storage pools from the same server mounted on a host. Changing the nconnect mount option on one of the storage pools via CloudStack will not do anything. To change the nconnect setting on the host, after modifying nconnect  mount option on all storage pools, the host needs to be restarted.\r\n\r\nThis addresses https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4482\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/396\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-04-24 11-00-39](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/c1c4213a-7bde-44f9-9827-34338a47a9d5)\r\nPrimary Storage in Maintenance mode:\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-04-24 11-29-53](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/33eea2b7-64e4-4e55-8e4c-471336726da7)\r\nPrimary Storage not in Maintenance mode:\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-04-24 11-30-13](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/5b88ad1a-6c87-480b-bcfe-615aafaf9a23)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n#### Testcase : Mount failing due to incorrect mount options ####\r\n**Add new Primary Storage** fails if incorrect mount option is given. \r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-02 10-58-32](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/1f254143-011b-4d12-b527-51358a9d4f23)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile **updating mount options on a pre-existing pool** with incorrect options, cancel maintenance mode will not be able to mount the pool and throw an error.\r\nState of the Storage pool is changed to `Up` from `Maintenance` before mounting the pool.

Description\r\n\r\n#### 1. Problem description\r\n\r\nCurrently ACS allows the GUI personalization (color changing, add a personalized logo, and so on); however, those configurations are set for the whole environment, which does not allow Apache CloudStack to have a personalized GUI by domain, account and so on. In a scenario of cloud providers reselling the infrastructure, the current behavior does not allow the operators to personalize the GUI for each use case (reseller, domain, account, and so on).\r\n\r\n#### 2. Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nThis spec introduces the concept of Runtime White Label to the Apache CloudStack GUI, which combines the market concept of White Label and enables it to be configured in runtime and by scope (domain, account, and so on). Briefly, we will introduce APIs to allow the operators to define GUI themes for a set of Internet common names (fixed or wildcard), a set of ACS domain UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user), and a set of ACS account UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user). The APIs will receive the CSS and JSON configuration as parameter and will store them into the database. When accessing Apache CloudStack, the UI will retrieve the CSS and JSON configurations according to the access definition and import them into the browser. If there are no themes match, the GUI will fallback to the current environment configuration.\r\n\r\nOperations that create/modify/remove the themes will be registered with events in ACS.\r\n\r\n##### 2.1. Database model\r\n\r\nA table named `gui_themes` will be created in the `cloud` schema and will have the following columns:\r\n\r\n| Name | Type | Nullable | Default | Description |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| id | bigint(20) unsigned | No | Auto increment | - |\r\n| uuid | varchar(40) | No | null | - |\r\n| name | varchar(2048) | No | null | A name to identify the theme. |\r\n| description | varchar(4096) | Yes | null | A description for the theme. |\r\n| css | text | Yes | null | The CSS to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations. |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Name | Type | Nullable | Default | Description |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| json_configuration | text | Yes | null | The JSON with the configurations to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations.\r\n| common_names | text | Yes | null | A set of Internet common names (fixed or wildcard) separated by comma that can use the theme; e.g.: `*acme.com,acme2.com`. |\r\n| domain_uuids | text | Yes | null | A set of \\[ACS\\] domain IDs separated by comma that can use the theme.\r\n| account_uuids | text | Yes | null | A set of \\[ACS\\] account IDs separated by comma that can use the theme |\r\n| is_public | boolean | Yes | true | Defines whether a theme can be retrieved by anyone when only the `common_names` is informed. If the `domain_uuids` or `account_uuids` is informed, it is considered as `false`. |\r\n| created | datetime | No | null | When the theme was created. |\r\n| removed | datetime | Yes | null | When the theme was removed. |\r\n\r\n##### 2.2. APIs\r\n\r\nRight below there are the descriptions of the APIs to be introduced to allow the management of GUI themes by scope.\r\n\r\n###### 2.2.1. createGuiTheme\r\n\r\nThe API `createGuiTheme` will be accessible only by the operators (Root Admin accounts) and will allow them to create themes for several scopes. It will have the following parameters:\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Mandatory | Type | Default value | Length |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| name | A name to identify the theme. | Yes | String | null | 2048 |\r\n| description | A description for the theme. | No | String | null | 4096 |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Mandatory | Type | Default value | Length |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| css | The CSS to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| jsonconfiguration | The JSON with the configurations to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations. More details about the JSON configurations can be found in the <a href=\"#json-configurations\" class=\"internal-link\">JSON Configurations</a> session. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| commonnames | A set of Internet common names (fixed or wildcard) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme; e.g.: `*acme.com,acme2.com` | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| domainids | A set of \\[ACS\\] domain UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| accountids | A set of \\[ACS\\] account UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| ispublic | Defines whether a theme can be retrieved by anyone when only the `domainnames` is informed. If the `domainids` or `accountids` is informed, it is considered as `false`. | No | Boolean | true | - |\r\n\r\nEither `css` or `jsonconfiguration` parameter must be informed for the GUI theme creation. If neither `commonnames`, `domainids`, and `accountids` is defined, the theme will be considered as the default; there can exist only one default theme and it automatically will be public. If there are no themes match, the GUI will fallback to the current environment configuration.\r\n\r\n###### 2.2.2. listGuiThemes\r\n\r\nThe API `listGuiThemes` will be accessible by anyone and will retrieve the themes according to the parameters and the caller access. It will have the following parameters:\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Mandatory | Type | Default value | Length |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| id | The theme ID. | No | String | null | 40 |\r\n| name | The name of the theme. | No | String | null | 2048 |\r\n| commonname | The Internet common name to be filtered. | No | String | null | 256 |\r\n| domainid | The UUID (also known as ID for the end-user) of the domain to be filtered. | No | String | null | 40 |\r\n| accountid | The UUID (also known as ID for the end-user) of the account to be filtered. | No | String | null | 40 |\r\n| listall | Whether to list all themes. | No | Boolean | false | - |\r\n| listremoved | Whether to list removed themes. | No | Boolean | false | - |\r\n| ispublic | Whether to list public themes. By default, it lists them all. | No | Boolean | null | - |\r\n| listonlydefaulttheme | Whether to list only the default theme. If this parameter is `true`, than all other parameters are ignored. | No | Boolean | false | - |\r\n\r\nIn order to allow the theme to be displayed yet in the login web page, it will be possible to call this API without authentication; however, there will be limitations and all the parameters will be ignored. An unauthenticated call to the API `listGuiThemes` will retrieve no entry or only a single entry; the single entry will be the default theme or the public, most recently, and active theme that matches the Internet common name requesting the API.\r\n\r\n###### 2.2.3. updateGuiTheme\r\n\r\nThe API `updateGuiTheme` will be accessible only by the operators (Root Admin accounts) and will allow them to update a theme. It will have the following parameters:\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Mandatory | Type | Default value | Length |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| id | The ID of the theme to be updated. | Yes | String | null | 40 |\r\n| name | A name to identify the theme. | No | String | null | 2048 |\r\n| description | A description for the theme. | No | String | null | 4096 |\r\n| css | The CSS to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| jsonconfiguration | The JSON with the configurations to be retrieved and imported into the GUI when matching the theme access configurations. More details about the JSON configurations can be found in the <a href=\"#json-configurations\" class=\"internal-link\">JSON Configurations</a> session. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| commonnames | A set of Internet common names (fixed or wildcard) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme; e.g.: `*acme.com,acme2.com` | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| domainids | A set of \\[ACS\\] domain UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme. | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| accountids | A set of \\[ACS\\] account UUIDs (also known as ID for the end-user) separated by comma that can retrieve the theme | No | String | null | 65535 |\r\n| ispublic | Defines whether a theme can be retrieved by anyone when only the `domainnames` is informed. If the `domainids` or `accountids` is informed, it is considered as `false`. | No | Boolean | null | - |\r\n\r\nBy default, all the parameters are `null`; therefore, to remove one of the parameters, it will be necessary to explicitly pass it as an empty string. If `commonnames`, `domainids`, and `accountids` are passed as empty, the theme will be considered as the default; there can exist only one default theme and it automatically will be public. If there are no themes match, the GUI will fallback to the current environment configuration.\r\n\r\n###### 2.2.4. removeGuiTheme\r\n\r\nThe API `removeGuiTheme` will be accessible only by the operators (Root Admin accounts) and will allow them to remove a theme. It will have the following parameter:\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Mandatory | Type | Default value | Length |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| id | The UUID (also known as ID for the end-user) of the theme to be removed. | Yes | String | null | 40 |\r\n\r\nIf the default theme is removed and there is no match to a theme access configuration, the GUI will fallback to the current environment configuration.\r\n\r\n##### 3.0. Future works\r\n\r\nWith this proposal, it will be only possible to manage the themes via API; for the future, we plan to add support for the themes management on the GUI. We will extend the feature to comply with projects, identity federation and domains change. Also, we will extend the feature to allow domain admins and users to manage their own themes.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nThere were two themes added with this PR: Dark theme and Apache Foundation theme.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new feature to add implicit host tags via agent.properties\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to provider CloudStack users another way to set host tags.\r\nFor example, based on hardware which can be detected by scripts/commands, users can add different host tags (e.g. GPU, gpu type, SSD, raid type, network card type). \r\nCurrently users have to use CloudStack API to manage the host tags.

Description\r\n\r\nThe logs related to the CPVM connection are not enough to perform a great troubleshooting process.\r\n\r\nThis PR, therefore, adds logs and improves the existing ones in order to facilitate the CPVM connection troubleshooting. Furthermore, the legacy CPVM log proxy classes have been removed, in order to let the CPVM classes use log4j dependencies directly.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability for a Scheduled execution timing to be adjusted dynamically. Normally, adjusting the interval that these run requires a restart of the management services, which can be problematic for experimenting with intervals or just making adjustments without downtime.\r\n\r\nIntroduces `ConfigKeyScheduledExecutionWrapper` that can read a `Long` from a `ConfigKey` and dynamically adjust execution interval. The current implementation only supports emulating the behavior of `scheduleAtFixedRate` - meaning if the first run is at `N`, the next is at `N + configKey.value()`, ignoring the run time of the task itself. If the task takes longer than `configKey.value()`, the next run occurs immediately.\r\n\r\nThis PR also converts `ResourceCountCheckTask` to run on dynamic interval.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manual testing.\r\n\r\nI tested the following sceenarios:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a volume that was created with linked clone is live migrated from an NFS storage to another NFS storage in KVM, it continues to have the template as a backing file on the destination storage. In all other cases, such as NFS to SharedMountPoint, the volume is consolidated with its backing file during migration.\r\n\r\n~This special case adds unnecessary complexity to ACS; In most cases, performing the migration without consolidating the volume does not significantly optimize resource usage. On the other hand, when consolidating the volume with its backing file, the hypervisor detects empty sectors and removes them from the final volume, therefore, consolidating the volume can reduce storage usage.~\r\n\r\nInstead of only maintaining linked clone only on NFS to NFS migration, we now maintain it when migrating between NFS, shared mount-point and local storage, as all of these are file based and have no reason to always consolidate the volumes.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the situations explained in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7615 and https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8834, we consolidate the volume when its template is deleted.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause

(if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI've tested creating a VM and migrating between NFS/SMP/Local storage, all migrations were successful, the template was copied to the storage and the VM was not corrupted.\r\n\r\nI've also tested creating a VM, force deleting its template and then migrating it, the migration consolidated the volume, and the VM was not corrupted.","created_at":"2024-04-12T19:53:10Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T09:51:41Z","closed_at":"2024-10-02T16:15:29Z","merged_at":"2024-10-02T16:15:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"e666dca403d48765aac3692bf59566eae4285200","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mlsorensen","id":1047709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gpordeus","id":22242548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQyNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22242548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus","html_url":"https://github.com/gpordeus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpordeus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"harikrishna-patnala","id":3348673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala","html_url":"https://github.com/harikrishna-patnala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/repos","events_url":"https://api.gith

Description\r\n\r\nUsing KVM as a hypervisor, when performing a live migration of a VM with a volume, if the volume is on local storage and the migration destination is an NFS storage, an error occurs during the migration. This happens because there is a validation to check whether the destination host has direct access to the source storage of the volume being migrated. However, this validation is not necessary, since the host that will perform the migration is the source host itself. Therefore, the destination host only needs access to the destination storage.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the following live volume migration cases failed in KVM:\r\n\r\n| Volume |  Origin |  Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | Local | NFS1 |\r\n| DATA1 | Local | NFS1 |\r\n\r\n| Volume |  Origin |  Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | Local | NFS1 |\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the above cases now work.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing KVM as a hypervisor, when performing a live migration of a VM with its datadisks, the ROOT volume is also migrated, even if the user has not requested this action. Since this migration of the root volume is unnecessary and causes greater latency for the live migrate process, this behavior has been changed. Now, when migrating a VM and its datadisks, only the volumes selected for migration will actually be migrated.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n### Description of tests\r\n\r\nA new VM was created with a root and a data volume for testing; Several live migration scenarios were tested. The cases are described below.\r\n\r\nThe following migrations occurred successfully, in each case, when only the datadisk was moved, a dump of the VM XML was performed to verify that the ROOT volume had not been moved.\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | iSCSI2 |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | --- |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | --- |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | iSCSI2 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | iSCSI2 |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | iSCSI2 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | Local |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | Local |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | Local | iSCSI1 |\r\n| DATA1 | Local | iSCSI1 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | NFS1 |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | NFS1 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | NFS1 |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | --- |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | iSCSI1 | --- |\r\n| DATA1 | iSCSI1 | NFS1 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | NFS2 |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | NFS2 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | Local |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | Local |\r\n\r\nThe following migrations ended in error. However, the error is expected, because, as described in #8907, when migrating the VM + volume and not migrating all NFS volumes, an error occurs. This error will be fixed in another PR.\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | Local |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | --- |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | --- |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | Local |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | NFS2 |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | --- |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | NFS2 |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | --- |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | ISCSI1 | --- |\r\n| DATA1 | NFS1 | ISCSI1 |\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | NFS1 | --- |\r\n| DATA1 | ISCSI1 | NFS1 |\r\n\r\nThe following migration ended in error; however, this case is due to another bug that was also described in #8907: when migrating to an NFS storage, ACS will validate if the destination host has access to the source storage. This causes an issue when migrating from local storage to NFS storage, as the destination host will never have direct access to the source host's local storage. This bug will be fixed in another PR.\r\n\r\n| Volume | Origin | Destination |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| ROOT | Local | NFS1 |\r\n| DATA1 | Local | NFS1

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issues which occur when increment/decrement methods are waiting for a lock on domain tables and `ResourceCountCheckTask` is running at the same time. This issue appears when innodb_lock_wait_timeout is many times less than the time it takes for `recalculateDomainResourceCount` to complete. (Check steps below on how to reproduce the error).\r\n```java\r\ncom.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException: DB Exception on: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ClientPreparedStatement: SELECT resource_count.id, resource_count.type, resource_count.account_i\r\nd, resource_count.domain_id, resource_count.count, resource_count.tag FROM resource_count WHERE resource_count.id IN (33,4785,3513,4845)  FOR UPDATE \r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.searchIncludingRemoved(GenericDaoBase.java:438)\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.searchIncludingRemoved(GenericDaoBase.java:366)\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.search(GenericDaoBase.java:355)\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.lockRows(GenericDaoBase.java:341)\r\n        .....\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe do this by removing unnecessary locks and simplifying count updates.\r\n\r\nAs of now, to calculate the resource count for root domain, we are taking the lock on the entire table.\r\nThis PR also splits the domain count calculation transaction into multiple transactions locks. This is done by breaking up the domain count calculation process by:\r\n1. Calculate resource count for all accounts in a domain\r\n2. Calculate resource count for all child domains in a domain\r\n3. In a transaction, fetch the child domain & accounts count and update the count if required\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n1. Setup multiple domains & networks. And update their limits. I used the below command.\r\n```bash\r\ncsbench -create -domain -network -limits\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# csbench-config\r\nnumdomains = 10\r\nnumnetworks = 1\r\nnumvms = 100\r\nstartvm = false  # For faster creation of VMs\r\n```\r\n2. Check the time it takes for resource count calculation to run. To manually trigger resource count calculation, run this command:\r\n```bash\r\ntime cmk update resourcecount domainid=1\r\n```\r\n3. Update `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to a value less than by a few seconds it took for the above request to complete.\r\n```sql\r\nSET GLOBAL innodb_lock_wait_timeout=3;\r\n```\r\n4. Restart the management server for `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` change to take effect.\r\n5. Run the below commands.\r\n```\r\ncsbench -create -vm -workers=50\r\ncsbench -teardown -vm -workers=50\r\n```\r\nIn parallel to above requests, execute `cmk update resourcecount domainid=1` to trigger resource count recalculation while VMs are getting created or destroyed.\r\n\r\n6. Check logs for `ClientPreparedStatement`.\r\n```bash\r\ngrep \"ClientPreparedStatement\" vmops.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\n\r\n##### With patch - creation of VM in stopped

Description\r\n\r\nIn a situation where there is a stopped user VM and this VM's network VR is also stopped, starting the user VM will also cause the VR to start. However, in this situation, the VR is inheriting the user VM's boot parameters, causing it to not start when the user VM has the UEFI boot type.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the inheritance of user VM boot parameters has been removed from VR and other boot parameters have been defined in their place.\r\n\r\nFixes: #8734\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI followed the same steps from `How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?` and verified that the user's VM and VR started correctly.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n1. Using VMware, I created an isolated network (`isolated`);\r\n2. I deployed a VM (`test`) using the `isolated` network and started it;\r\n3. After implementing the `isolated` network, I stopped the VM `test` and the VR of the `isolated` network;\r\n4. I added the `UEFI=SECURE` setting to the `test` VM and started it again, causing the `isolated` network VR to start as well;\r\n5. The VR could not start because it had the UEFI boot

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a number of bug fixes to the Primera and Pure storage array discovered in working environments after the release of 4.19.0.0.  \r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behavior functionally changed. -->\r\nThe following items are addressed:\r\n\r\n1.  Switched to a host-centric rather than hostgroup-centric vlun assignment model.  hostgroup-centric works better for shared filesystems but the direct volume attach method for these drivers is better suited to per-host vlun assignments.  This required changes to how vlun id's are stored as well as a number of changes in the storage framework to add missing grantAccess/revokeAccess calls or reorder those calls so data is properly available in the Disk objects sent to agents.\r\n2. Improved error handling and logging in the storage portion of the agent when copying volumes.\r\n3. Fix to properly handle storage tag to storage provider mapping when migrating disks to a different storage provider and selecting a new disk offering.\r\n4. Fix an issue related to template removal on primary storage for Pure when all volumes using the template are deleted.  Pure storage 'saves' the volume in a Deleted area for some period of time after deletion so any recreation of the volume on subsequent volume creations will trigger an error.  The fix renames the volume prior to deletion by appending a timestamp.\r\n5. Small issues with oAuth login discovered during testing when incorrect user password is entered at the login prompt.\r\n6. Several small logging cleanups in a few modules that were producing unnecessary noise at INFO level.\r\n7. Various exception/error handling improvements in storage classes to improve triage/debugging of storage/volume issues.\r\n8. Fix for issue #8789 .\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviors, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!--

Description\r\n\r\nI encountered a situation, where libvirt/CloudStack believed a nfs/secondary storage was correctly mounted\r\nand the agent wrote images without any problem into it.\r\nIt turned out, that it just wrote everything into a a local /mnt/<uuid> directory and later was only found, because\r\nwe couldn't create instances(on a other agent) of the just created template.\r\n\r\nI don't know yet how the agent/node got into this state, thinking everything was mounted ok, but instead\r\nwriting into a local directory.\r\n\r\nThis should check after creating the mount that it is really mounted and fail if not.\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the checkAccess of when assigning a VM to check for the template itself instead of the account owner of the template. In this way, there is no need for checking if the template is public (it already does so inside checkAccess) and it gives a better message when the assigning fails because of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to move vm due to Account [...] does not have permission to launch instances from template [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n```\r\nFailed to move vm due to Account [{\"accountName\":\"[...]\",\"id\":[...],\"uuid\":\"[...]\"}] does not have permission to operate with resource\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, current ACS lets you assign a VM with a public template of domain B to an account of domain A even if `share.public.templates.with.other.domains` is false. This also fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab with:\r\n- In domain /A, a domain admin and a user.

Description\r\n\r\nAs of now, logs which get logged to journalctl also get logged to file. In one of the environments, we saw some logs which were present in journalctl but not in management-server.log file. This PR disables the logging to stdout and logs which are not getting captured will be logged to a file.\r\n\r\nAfter this change,\r\n1. stdout of cloudstack services is logged to files\r\n2. Disable log4j logs from stdout to prevent duplication of logs\r\n3. Add log rotation for stdout logs\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the API `extractSnapshot` so one can download volume snapshots that are backed up on secondary storage.\r\n\r\nIt checks if extraction is disabled and, if caller has access and the snapshot was found, it returns the download url, in the same way as Template/ISO extraction.\r\n\r\nIt adds the `download_url` and `download_url_created` columns to `snapshot_store_ref` table and adds a download button to the GUI volume snapshot page.\r\n\r\nIt also extracts duplicate code of Template/ISO and Volume Extraction around ExtractResponse.\r\n\r\n### Types of

Has This Been Tested?\r\nI deployed a ubuntu VM, took a volume snapshot and downloaded it through the UI.\r\n\r\nI then uploaded the volume to ACS, deployed a new VM, attached the uploaded volume to

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the functionality to change the scope of the Primary storage from zone to cluster scope and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeature is tested and supported for \r\nHypervisors : KVM and VMware (Simulator will also work)\r\nProtocol : NFS and Ceph, and \r\nStorage Provider : Default Primary\r\n\r\n>  Although the supported configuration is mentioned above, the root admin can use this feature for other configurations as well, but proper warning would be given that officially this feature is only tested for a limited set of hypervisor-storage configuration. And other configurations might not work and need some extra steps.\r\nWe will give this information in the UI prompt as well as Api docs. Apache CloudStack documentation will also get a mention on what hypervisors/storage is supported.\r\n\r\nDocumentation PR : https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/395\r\n\r\nThe option for scope change is provided as a new action button to root admin once a Primary storage has been disabled.\r\n\r\nA new api changeStoragePoolScope handles the execution after doing all relevant checks. It makes DB changes and also connects to the hypervisor hosts to add or remove the storage pool as required. It adds the storage pool to the applicable hosts when the scope is changing from Cluster to Zone. And it removes the storage pool from the hosts when the scope is changing from Zone to Cluster. Management server or the Cloudstack agents don’t need to be restarted for this.\r\n\r\nScope change from Zone to Cluster cannot be done if there are volumes associated with running-VMs belonging to other clusters. Api will throw an error in this case.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-04-02 02-45-12](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/cbfd74b9-2903-46fe-8d6d-393441198f37)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/9165274a-e5e7-4947-af15-0c6603491194)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/f82c12ff-544c-4767-86ac-83b6db4c85e8)\r\n\r\nError while moving the scope from zone to cluster and \"list affectedvmsforstoragescopechange\" response\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-22 10-32-42](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/7a19d6a6-13c7-492c-804a-dde9883675a9)\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-22 10-32-56](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/63767682/9b721056-4b37-4783-9ca5-153c63faeec6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### KVM + NFS ####\r\n##### Cluster to Zone #####\r\n1. Verified that Scope is changing correctly. Hosts in other clusters have the storage pool mounted.\r\n2. New instance on other clusters are able to use the storage pool\r\n3. Offline a host in Cluster C2. Change the scope from C1 to Zone. Online the host and verify that the storage pool gets mounted on the host.\r\n\r\n##### Zone to Cluster #####\r\n1. Verified that Scope is changing correctly. Hosts in other clusters don't have the storage pool mounted.\r\n2. Offline a host in Cluster C2. Change the scope from Zone to Cluster C1. Online the host and verify that the storage pool gets gets removed from the host.\r\n3. Deploy a VM in Cluster C2 having a volume in the Zone wide storage pool. Change scope from Zone to C1 fails as we have a volume from C2 in the storage pool.\r\n4. Repeat of # 2 but the VM is in stopped state. This time scope change from Zone to C1 succeeds. Restart of the VM succeeds in C1 as the storage pool is now present in C1. \r\n\r\n#### VMware + NFS ####\r\nTested basic functionality.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your

Begin by setting up a new Simulator zone, ready to deploy VMs.\r\n\r\n1. create a test domain and account\r\n2. create an NFS storage pool with a tag, e.g. \"fast\"\r\n3. enable `resource.limit.storage.tags` for \"fast\" storage\r\n4. create a disk offering with custom size, and storage tag \"fast\"\r\n5. set primary storage limit for test domain and storage tag \"fast\", e.g. 5 GiB limit\r\n6. launch a VM, using override root disk offering pointing to the \"fast\" offering, and size that goes beyond user's \"fast\" limit.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is
