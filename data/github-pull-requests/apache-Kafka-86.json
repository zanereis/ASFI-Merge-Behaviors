Running multiple processes in the same physical state directory is not supported, and as of [PR #9978](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9978) it's explicitly guarded against), so there's no reason to continue locking the task directories with anything heavier than an in-memory map.\r\n\r\nRipping out out the task-level filesystem locks not only cleans up the code, but removes an occasional source of trouble due to IOExceptions. We now use only an umbrella lock of the state directory itself which is held for the lifetime of the application.\r\n\r\nWe can probably cherrypick this back to 2.6 since that's how far back we merged

new `RocksDBTimeOrderedWindowStore` stores key/value records with a combined key that starts with the record timestamp, followed by a sequential number and the key in bytes (`<time,seq,key>`). This key combination will keep all records ordered by timestamp in the RocksDB store. The advantage of keeping records this way is to make range queries functions more efficient, like `fetchAll(from, to)`. This range method returns all keys in the specified time range using a more efficient key schema to iterate on RocksDB.\r\n\r\n`RocksDBTimeOrderedWindowStore` with key query ranges, like `fetch(key, from, to)` or `fetch(keyFrom, keyTo, from, to)`, do not perform very well. For cases with key query ranges, it is better to use the current `RocksDBWindowStore` which stores records using the record key as the RocksDB key prefix. `RocksDBTimeOrderedWindowStore` is meant to fix the issue with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10847 which requires a temporary store where to hold non-joined records, and later do a query range of all keys in a specified time range.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

patch changes the raft simulation tests to use jqwik, which is a property testing library.

Currently the tests use a fixed set of `Random` seeds, which means that most builds are doing redundant work. We get a bigger benefit from allowing each build to test different parameterizations.\r\n- It makes it easier to reproduce failures. Whenever a test fails, jqwik will report the random seed that failed. A developer can then modify the `@Property` annotation to use that specific seed in order to reproduce the failure.\r\n\r\nNote that I have resisted making logical changes to the tests themselves.

was failing when used with a Raft-based metadata quorum but succeeding with a ZooKeeper-based quorum.  This patch increases the consumers' session timeouts to 30 seconds, which fixes the Raft case and also eliminates flakiness that has historically existed in the Zookeeper case.  This patch also fixes a minor logging bug in `RaftReplicaManager.endMetadataChangeDeferral()` that was discovered during the debugging of this issue, and it adds an extra logging statement in `RaftReplicaManager.handleMetadataRecords()` when a single metadata batch is applied to mirror the same logging statement that occurs when deferred metadata changes are applied.\r\n\r\nIn the Raft system test case the consumer was sometimes receiving a METADATA response with just 1 alive broker, and then when that broker rolled the consumer wouldn't know about any alive nodes.  It would have to wait until the broker returned before it could reconnect, and by that time the group coordinator on the second broker would have timed-out the client and initiated a group rebalance.  The test explicitly checks that no rebalances occur, so the test would fail.  It turns out that the reason why the ZooKeeper configuration wasn't seeing rebalances was just plain luck.  The brokers' metadata caches in the ZooKeeper configuration show 1 alive broker even more frequently than the Raft configuration does.  If we tweak the metadata.max.age.ms value on the consumers we can easily get the ZooKeeper test to fail, and in fact this system test has historically been flaky for the ZooKeeper configuration.  We can get the test to pass by setting session.timeout.ms=30000 (which is longer than the roll time of any broker), or we can increase the broker count so that the client never sees a METADATA response with just a single alive broker and therefore never loses contact with the cluster for an extended period of time.  We have plenty of system tests with 3+ brokers, so we choose to keep this test with 2 brokers and increase the session timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

This can lead to degenerate behavior where a partition's hwm or log start offset is updated resulting in the next fetch being unnecessarily skipped for that partition. At first this appeared to be worse, as hwm updates occur frequently, but starvation should result in hwm movement becoming blocked, allowing a fetch to go through and then becoming unstuck. However, it'll still require one more fetch request than necessary to do so. Consumers may be affected more than replica fetchers, however they often remove partitions with fetched data from the next fetch request and this may be helping prevent starvation.\r\n\r\n###

the Raft leader raises an exception if there is a non-monotonic update to the fetch offset of a replica. In a situation where the replica had lost it disk state, this would prevent the replica from being able to recover. In this patch, we relax the validation to address this problem. It is worth pointing out that this validation could not be relied on to protect from data loss after a voter has lost committed state.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

the root cause about why the the test `shouldNotViolateEosIfOneTaskFailsWithState` failed sometimes with unexpected committed/uncommitted result. The reason is the **unexpected rebalance** during committing messages, and it causes the fail over mechanism. And the reason why the rebalance is triggered is because we reduce the `max.poll.interval.ms` value to **5 seconds** (default is 5 mins) for the `shouldNotViolateEosIfOneTaskGetsFencedUsingIsolatedAppInstances` test, which is trying to stall a thread, and wait for exceeding the `max.poll.interval.ms`, and trigger the rebalance. As we know, under `withState` situation, we have more things to handle with the state and additional topics..., so it explains why only the `shouldNotViolateEosIfOneTaskFailsWithState` is flaky, not other tests. In this rockDB tuning in kafka stream article also mentioned:\r\n>  If writes to RocksDB stall, the time interval between the invocations of poll() may exceed max.poll.interval.ms. To avoid this, you can increase max.poll.interval.ms in your Kafka Streams application.\r\n\r\nref: https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-to-tune-rocksdb-kafka-streams-state-stores-performance/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.bp-tune-rocksdb-for-kafka-streams-application_content.stream-processing#increase-max.poll.interval.ms\r\n\r\nI increased the `max.poll.interval.ms` for the `withState` test to fix the flaky test. Also, did some enhancement:\r\n1. add failed reason. Currently, the failed message is like: `Expected: <[...]>, but: was: <[...]>`, and it didn't tell us the result is committed or uncommitted result, before injected error or after. We have to map the stack trace to know it. Improve it\r\n2. The fail() in `uncaughtException` will only fail the stream thread, not the test. fix it/\r\n3. add the capacity for the ArrayList to avoid memory reallocation.\r\n4. Improve the comments, and add the state view for each phase\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

system tests in `zookeeper_security_upgrade_test.py` and `zookeeper_tls_test.py` broke due to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10199/.  That patch changed the logic of `SecurityConfig.enabled_sasl_mechanisms()` to only add the inter-broker SASL mechanism when the inter-broker protocol was `SASL_{PLAINTEXT,SSL}`.  The inter-broker protocol is left to default to `PLAINTEXT` for the `SecurityConfig` instance associated with Zookeeper since that value doesn't apply to ZooKeeper, so the default inter-broker SASL mechanism of `GSSAPI` was not being added into the set returned by `enabled_sasl_mechanisms()`.  This is actually correct -- `GSSAPI` shouldn't be added since inter-broker communication is a Kafka concept and doesn't apply to ZooKeeper.  `GSSAPI` should be added when ZooKeeper uses it, though -- which is the case in these tests.  So the prior patch referred to above uncovered a bug: we were relying on the default inter-broker SASL mechanism to signal that Kerberos was being used by ZooKeeper even though the inter-broker protocol has nothing to do with that determination in such cases.  This patch explicitly includes `GSSAPI` in the list of enabled SASL mechanisms when SASL is enabled for use by ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

introduced partition.metadata file to persist the topic ID on the broker. It is created through handling the LeaderAndIsrRequest in ReplicaManager. (See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10143 for the code path.) RaftReplicaManager was missing the analogue code path for Kip-500 code. Like in ReplicaManager, RaftReplicaManager will now check the partition.metadata file when handling metadata records.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we know that all raft topics will have topic IDs, we can simply set the ID in the log upon the log's creation.\r\nUpdated the ReplicaManager path to do the same on newly created topics.\r\n\r\nThere are some tweaks to the checking logic to better handle the scenario when the log exists but is not yet associated to Partition (for example, upon startup after a shutdown).\r\n\r\nTests added to ensure the file is created and that the correct error is thrown when the id is inconsistent.\r\nAdded tests for creating the log with the new topic ID parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a few methods to get topic ID from MetadataImageBuilder as this is the most convenient way to get topic ID from RaftReplicaManager.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

if we assigned one or more calls to a remote node, but it\r\nnever became available, we would block until the calls hit their the API\r\ntimeout.  This was particularly unfortunate in the case where the calls\r\ncould have been sent to a different node in the cluster.  This PR fixes\r\nthis behavior by timing out pending connections to remote nodes if they\r\ntake longer than the request timeout.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other small cleanups in this PR: it removes the\r\nunecessary Call#aborted, sets Call#curNode to null after the call has\r\nfailed to avoid confusion when debugging or logging, and adds a\r\n\"closing\" boolean rather than setting newCalls to null when the client\r\nis closed.  Also, it increases the log level of the log message that\r\nindicates that we timed out some calls because AdminClient closed.","created_at":"2021-03-08T22:36:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T18:10:25Z","closed_at":"2021-03-24T18:10:20Z","merged_at":"2021-03-24T18:10:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"11f0ea3a5e692f7b68e05f287e73ffc0f7fd073c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6a00c1d8f12fcfcc3306d93f86f031d9f596871b","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-12432","ref":"KAFKA-12432","sha":"6a00c1d8f12fcfcc3306d93f86f031d9f596871b","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR implements the details of the Log layer refactor, as outlined in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQJL4MCwqQJSPmZkVmVzshFZKuFy_bCPtubav4wBfHQ/edit. Few details maybe different from the doc, but it is more or less the same.\r\n\r\n**STRATEGY:**\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I've extracted a new class called `LocalLog` out of `Log`.  Currently `LocalLog` is purely an implementation detail thats not exposed outside `Log` class (except for tests). The object encapsulation is that each `Log` instance  wraps around a `LocalLog` instance.\r\n\r\nThis new `LocalLog` class attempts to encompass **most** of the responsibilities of local log surrounding the `segments` map, which otherwise were present in `Log` previously. Note that **not** all local log responsibilities have been moved over to this new class (yet). The criteria I used was to preserve (for now) in existing `Log` class, any logic that is mingled  in a complex manner with the `logStartOffset` or the `LeaderEpochCache` or the `ProducerStateManager`.\r\n\r\n**WINS:**\r\n\r\nThe main win is that the new `LocalLog` class is now agnostic of the `logStartOffset`, which continues to be managed mainly by `Log` class. Below is the local log functionality that has successfully moved over from `Log` to `LocalLog`:\r\n\r\n1. Access of `LogSegments` instance containing the local `LogSegment` objects.\r\n2. Read path logic to read records from the log.\r\n2. Segment file deletion logic.\r\n3. Segment truncation logic.\r\n4. Segment roll logic.\r\n5. Segment split logic.\r\n6. Segment replacement logic.\r\n\r\nBelow is the main local log functionality that continues to remain in `Log`:\r\n\r\n1. Segment append logic. The reason is that the below logic is mingled with one or more of the following: `logStartOffset` or `LeaderEpochCache` or `ProducerStateManager`. This makes it hard to separate just the local logic out of it.\r\n2. Last stable offset and logic surrounding it.\r\n3. High watermark and logic surrounding it.\r\n4. Logic to `fetchOffsetByTimestamp` and logic to `legacyFetchOffsetsBefore`.\r\n5. Some of the retention logic thats related with the global view of the log.\r\n6. All other logic related with handling  `LeaderEpochCache` and `ProducerStateManager`.\r\n\r\n**PAINPOINTS:**\r\n\r\n1. Log locking semantics had to be changed in handful of areas, with lock taken at a coarse level.\r\n2. Few API implementations needed re-ordering of logic in `Log` class to make migration feasible.\r\n3. Certain APIs added to `LocalLog` are crude in nature or signature, examples: `def checkIfMemoryMappedBufferClosed`, `def markFlushed`, `def updateRecoveryPoint`, `def replaceSegments` etc.\r\n4. Certain important APIs (such as `def append` logic) were hard to migrate because logic was mingled with Leader epoch cache, Producer state manager and log start offset.\r\n\r\n**TESTS:**\r\n * New unit suite: `LocalLogTest.scala` has been provided containing tests specific to `LocalLog` class.\r\nAll other existing tests are expected to pass.\r\n * 6/10/2021: System test run on top of 28bf22af168ca0db76796b5d3cd67a38ed8ed1c2: https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4550/\r\n *  6/12/2021:\r\n    * System test runs [4560](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4560/) and [4562](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4562/) on top of 008b701386ce5a4d892d6ac5b90798b981c4fba0.\r\n    * System test runs [4561](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4561/) and [4563](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4563/) on top of `trunk/6de37e536ac76ef13530d49dc7320110332cd1ee`.\r\n    * `kafkatest.tests.client.consumer_test` rerun:\r\n        * [4564](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4564/) against  `trunk/6de37e536ac76ef13530d49dc7320110332cd1ee`.\r\n        * [4566](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4566/) on top of 008b701386ce5a4d892d6ac5b90798b981c4fba0.

patch adds the new `Admin` API to describe producer state as described by KIP-664: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-664%3A+Provide+tooling+to+detect+and+abort+hanging+transactions.\r\n\r\nThe three new APIs added by KIP-664 require different lookup and request patterns:\r\n\r\n- DescribeProducers: send to partition leaders\r\n- DescribeTransactions: send to coordinators\r\n- ListTransactions: send to all brokers\r\n\r\nOur method of handling complex workflows such as these in `KafkaAdminClient` by chaining together `Call` instances has been clumsy and error-prone at best. I have attempted to introduce a new pattern which separates the lookup stage (e.g. finding partition leaders) from the fulfillment stage (e.g. sending `DescribeProducers`). The lookup stage is implemented by `AdminApiLookupStrategy` and the fulfillment stage is implemented by `AdminApiHandler`. There is a new class `AdminApiDriver` which manages the bookkeeping for these two stages. See the corresponding javadocs for more detail. \r\n\r\nThis PR provides an example of usage through `DescribeProducersHandler`, which is an implementation of `AdminApiHandler`. It relies on `PartitionLeaderStrategy` which implements `AdminApiLookupStrategy`. One of the benefits of this approach is that it provides a more convenient way for testing since all of the logic is not crammed into `KafkaAdminClient`.\r\n\r\nIn the following PRs to implement the other two APIs introduced by KIP-664, I will also provide a coordinator lookup strategy and an \"all broker\" lookup strategy. You can get an idea of the usage from the previously closed PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9268.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

PR adds DescribeClientQuota RPC as a supported RPC of the raft broker. It also fixes the case where an empty set of entity filters in non-strict mode should return _all_ quota entities. Previously, we were returning no entities in this case. This bug was exposed when running ClientQuotaRequestTest in Raft mode.\r\n\r\nAlso included here is an example of running an existing integration test in ZK and self-managed mode. Since [ClientQuotaRequestTest](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10254/files#diff-f02b619b5cd14e83f7e21dbe211b3f88336f825e1ee5c630fee32b8a0fbe3d20) had previously been converted to use ClusterTestExtentions, enabling self-managed mode was simply a matter of adding the type to the annotation.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- @ClusterTestDefaults(clusterType = Type.ZK)\r\n+ @ClusterTestDefaults(clusterType = Type.BOTH)\r\n@ExtendWith(value = Array(classOf[ClusterTestExtensions]))\r\nclass ClientQuotasRequestTest(cluster: ClusterInstance) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nA new test case

PR implements `log4j2-appender`, a log4j2 equivalent of traditional `log4j-appender`.\r\n\r\nAll `log4j-appender` configuration properties are supported, with some additions:\r\n\r\n1. `brokerList` is deprecated for the consistency of the other CLI tools. `bootstrapServers` is added instead.\r\n2. `requiredNumAcks` is deprecated for the consistency of `Producer`'s `Properties` instance. `acks` is added instead.\r\n3. A new configuration option, `producerClass`, is added. Any `Producer` implementation with the `Properties` argument is supported. The unit test itself uses this feature with `MockProducer`.\r\n4. In `log4j-appender`, the default values of `retries`, `requiredNumAcks`, `deliveryTimeoutMs`, `lingerMs`, and `batchSize` are redundantly defined in `Log4jAppender` implementation. Since their default values are already defined in `ProducerConfig`, `log4j2-appender` does not define their default values.\r\n\r\nImplements
