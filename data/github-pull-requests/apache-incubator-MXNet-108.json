is by no means done yet, but I would like some early feedback :) I also don't expect this code to work in its current state. For me it is a rough draft of how I think things might work\n\nCurrently NativeOps creates a copy of the input/output data and then synchronizes the TBlobs afterwards. That is problematic for asynchronous operation, since in Julia `ctx.async_on_complete` needs to be called from the Julia side of the code and there can't be any operations afterwards.\n## Questions:\n- Is it allowed to create NDArrays like this [https://github.com/vchuravy/mxnet/blob/65409a1f6753f04239443c5011f4c40907a31d13/src/operator/native_op-inl.h#L57] ? Passing handel to NDArrays to Python and Julia makes things easier.\n- Currently `ctx.async_on_complete` is an object with a member function `operator()` getting a function pointer to a member function is quite tricky, any other ideas how we could handle this elegantly?\n\nCC: @piiswrong \nRef:

Training with the modified `example/imagenet/inception.py`, with ratio `10:10:3` for `K40c:K40c:K4000`, the training speedometer is shown as: \n\n```\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [100]   Speed: 92.63 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [150]   Speed: 91.22 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [200]   Speed: 92.20 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [250]   Speed: 92.53 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [300]   Speed: 92.55 samples/sec\n```\n\nWith only two Tesla GPUs, we observe a speed around \n\n```\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [12700] Speed: 80.39 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [12750] Speed: 80.27 samples/sec\nINFO:root:Iter[0] Batch [12800] Speed: 80.31 samples/sec\n```\n\nSo this uneven work load feature is able to squeeze the last GPU on the machine and slightly improve the performance.

size) at 5\n\nEpoch [32732] Train: NLL=4.494, Perp=89.517\nEpoch [32760] Train: NLL=4.496, Perp=89.678\nEpoch [32788] Train: NLL=4.498, Perp=89.866\nEpoch [32816] Train: NLL=4.501, Perp=90.100\nEpoch
