refactoring with no logical changes to lay the groundwork & facilitate reviews for error handling work.\r\n\r\nThis PR just moves all methods that go beyond the management of tasks into a new TaskExecutor class, such as processing, committing, and punctuating. This breaks up the ever-growing TaskManager class so it can focus on the tracking and updating of the tasks themselves, while the TaskExecutor can focus on the actual processing. In addition to cleaning up this code this should make it easier to test this part of the code.","created_at":"2022-02-08T09:06:00Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T08:39:41Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T08:39:41Z","merged_at":"2022-02-18T08:39:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c23e47bd5b04d49e1ef55b8a33ba18e72a818e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vvcephei","id":832787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/832787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei","html_url":"https://github.com/vvcephei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11738/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11738/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11738/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/34638a097b1c06f31e695a3a26591268de3c23fc","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:12648-identify-error-tasks","ref":"12648-identify-error-tasks","sha":"34638a097b1c06f31e695a3a26591268de3c23fc","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

of the protocol for starting and stopping leader recovery after an unclean leader election. This includes the management of state in the controllers (legacy and KRaft) and propagating this information to the brokers. This change doesn't implement log recovery after an unclean leader election.\r\n\r\n### Protocol Changes\r\nFor the topic partition state znode, the new field \"leader_recovery_state\" was added. If the field is missing the value is assumed to be RECOVERED.\r\n\r\nALTER_PARTITION was renamed from ALTER_ISR. The CurrentIsrVersion field was renamed to PartitionEpoch. The new field LeaderRecoveryState was added.\r\n\r\nThe new field LeaderRecoverState was added to the LEADER_AND_ISR request. The inter broker protocol version is used to determine which version to send to the brokers.\r\n\r\nA new tagged field for LeaderRecoveryState was added to both the PartitionRecord and PartitionChangeRecord.\r\n\r\n### Controller\r\nFor both the KRaft and legacy controller the LeaderRecoveryState is set to RECOVERING, if the leader was elected out of the ISR, also known as unclean leader election. The controller sets the state back to RECOVERED after receiving an ALTER_PARTITION request with version 0, or with version 1 and with the LeaderRecoveryState set to RECOVERED.\r\n\r\nBoth controllers preserve the leader recovery state even if the unclean leader goes offline and comes back online before an RECOVERED ALTER_PARTITION is sent.\r\n\r\nThe controllers reply with INVALID_REQUEST if the ALTER_PARTITION either:\r\n1. Attempts to increase the ISR while the partition is still RECOVERING\r\n2. Attempts to change the leader recovery state to RECOVERING from a RECOVERED state.\r\n\r\n### Topic Partition Leader\r\nThe topic partition leader doesn't implement any log recovery in this change. The topic partition leader immediately marks the partition as RECOVERED and sends that state in the next ALTER_PARTITION request.\r\n\r\n### Topic Partition Follower\r\nThe topic partition follower will reject FETCH requests with NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER while the leader is RECOVERING. The partition follower can receive FETCH requests because of KIP-392. The partition follower will start accepting requests after the leader has recovered and the follower has received a RECOVERED leader state through the LEADER_AND_ISR or through the partition records in the KRaft mode.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation\r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)","created_at":"2022-02-04T03:37:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T16:24:16Z","closed_at":"2022-03-18T16:24:11Z","merged_at":"2022-03-18T16:24:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"52621613fd386203773ba93903abd50b46fa093a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c7e54b8f6cef087deac119d61a46d3586ead72b9","head":{"label":"jsancio:kafka-13587-leader-recovery","ref":"kafka-13587-leader-recovery","sha":"c7e54b8f6cef087deac119d61a46d3586ead72b9","user":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169502372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk1MDIzNzI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jsancio/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio/kafka","description":"Mirror

0.7.17 locked a couple of dependencies to their last py2 compatible versions - this ensures more or less stable python 2 builds for kafkatest (until some other package breaks it).\r\nSince 2.7 and above uses ducktape 0.8.x and python 3, this change does not apply there.\r\n\r\nSee these PRs for details on ducktape:\r\nhttps://github.com/confluentinc/ducktape/pull/291\r\nhttps://github.com/confluentinc/ducktape/pull/292\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Ran `python setup.py develop` in a clean python 2.7.18 virtualenv to ensure all dependencies are installed without conflicts\r\n- Ran a small system test with `ducker-ak` just to ensure it still works ok\r\n    - had to hack the dockerfile since openjdk:8 image does not include py2 anymore it seems? Hacked something together to have some test run (it failed due to some java deps it seems, but ducktape part worked ok)\r\n    - because of this, the change to the Dockerfile is pretty much irrelevant\r\n- Ran a system test job on jenkins - https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/4776 \r\n    - used a custom test that simply brings up zk and kafka\r\n\r\n###

Add `Materialized.as(StoreType)` and `Materialized.withStoreType(StoreType)` API\r\n4. publish the `public StreamsBuilder(TopologyConfig)` constructor\r\n5. Create the expected store based on the type in for each implementation\r\n6. Add tests for different kinds of stores (most of the added codes are in tests)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-24T09:24:59Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T03:32:49Z","closed_at":"2022-03-17T02:19:42Z","merged_at":"2022-03-17T02:19:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"fbe7fb941173c0907792a8b48e8e9122aabecbd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

short, after v3.0, the default producer is still not idempotence enabled.\r\n\r\nIn v3.0, we make `enable.idempotence` default to true, but we didn't adjust the validator and the `idempotence` enabled check method, so that if user didn't explicitly enable idempotence, this feature won't be turned on. In this PR, I did:\r\n\r\n1. fix the `ProducerConfig#idempotenceEnabled` method, to make it correctly detect if `idempotence` is enabled or not\r\n2. remove some unnecessary config overridden and checks due to we already default `acks`, `retries` and `enable.idempotence` configs.\r\n3. move the config validator for idempotence producer from `KafkaProducer` into `ProducerConfig`. The config validation should be the responsibility of `ProducerConfig` class.\r\n4. add an `AbstractConfig#hasKeyInOriginals` method, to avoid `originals` configs get copied and only want to check the existence of the key. \r\n5. fix many broken tests. As mentioned, we didn't actually enable idempotence in v3.0. After this PR, there are some tests broken due to some different behavior between idempotence and non-idempotence producer. Fix them\r\n6. add tests\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

this patch, `RecordQueue` just skips records that failed to\r\ndeserialize when `DeserializationExceptionHandler` is set to\r\n`LogAndContinueExceptionHandler`. This way, if the entire stream consists\r\nof corrupted records, the task never updated consumed offsets.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a new record type - `CorruptedRecord` that\r\nwraps a raw record that failed to deserialize. `RecordQueue`'s `headRecord`\r\nbecomes `CorruptedRecord` if there were records in the `fifoQueue` and all\r\nof them failed to deserialize. In turn, `StreamTask#process` checks that\r\na found record is not corrupted before processing it. If the record is\r\nan instance of `CorruptedRecord`, it updates the offset, sets `commitNeeded`\r\nto `true` and returns.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

IQv2 forwards all queries to the underlying store. We add this bypass to allow handling of key queries in the cache. If a key exists in the cache, it will get answered from there.\r\nAs part of this PR, we realized we need access to the position of the underlying stores. So, I added the method `getPosition` to the public API and ensured all state stores implement it. Only the \"leaf\" stores (Rocks*, InMemory*) have an actual position, all wrapping stores access their wrapped store's position. \r\n\r\nRan IQv2StoreIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

initializing `adminClient`, we'll first fetch the metadata of the brokers. Usually, we expected the brokers are already up (and metadata are updated in server side). So that we can choose 1 node to connect to in the following request. But if we only fetch \"partial\" metadata of the brokers, and after the \"partial\" brokers shutdown, the `adminClient` will not work anymore due to no nodes to connect to.\r\n\r\nSo, the reason why this test is flaky is because we have race condition at the beginning of the test, when brokers are staring up, and the `adminClient` is requesting for brokers metadata. Once the `adminClient` only got broker2/broker3, the test will fail, because in these tests, broker2 and broker3 will be shutdown to test leader election. \r\n\r\nFix this issue by explicitly waiting for metadata cache up-to-date in `waitForReadyBrokers`, and let admin client get created after `waitForReadyBrokers`.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment.

cleans up a few things in ClusterInstance to make it more usable. Also fixes some old \"raft\" references.\r\n\r\nI also adjusted the parameter injection that ClusterTestExtensions is doing to allow test classes to directly inject the specific type. This allows for easier implementation specific tests. For example, getting direct access to a MetadataImage when running a KRaft cluster:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   @ClusterTest(clusterType = Type.KRAFT, brokers = 1, controllers = 1)\r\n    public void testKRaftMetadataImage(KRaftClusterInstance instance) {\r\n        MetadataImage image = instance.brokerCurrentMetadataImages().get(0);\r\n        assertTrue(image.cluster().brokers().containsKey(0));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should make it easier to write a class of tests where we want running controllers/brokers, but don't want to be restricted to using the APIs to test things.","created_at":"2022-01-13T22:25:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T03:34:20Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T03:34:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

is part of the implementation of KIP-778.\r\n\r\n## Introduce metadata.version\r\nA new feature flag `metadata.version` is defined. Brokers statically declare their supported versions in BrokerFeatures. Controllers do so in a similar way with QuorumFeatures. Brokers cannot register with the quorum unless they support the current `metadata.version` in use by the quorum. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Bootstrapping\r\nWhen using the `kafka-storage.sh format` command, we now can specify which `metadata.version` to bootstrap the cluster with. \r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t LMmPeCgST7S6F3NgoVcrwA -c config/kraft/server.properties -v 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no `metadata.version` is given, the latest stable version is automatically selected. The selected value is written into the `meta.properties` file as the \"initial.metadata.version\" property.\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n#\r\n#Thu Jan 13 14:05:12 EST 2022\r\ncluster.id=LMmPeCgST7S6F3NgoVcrwA\r\nversion=1\r\ninit.metadata.version=2\r\nnode.id=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n> For KRaft preview clusters, meta.properties will already exist and not include the new \"initial.metadata.version\" property. In this case, the controller will automatically select version 1 on startup.\r\n\r\nOn first start up with this PR, the controller that is first elected leader upon startup will initialize a FeatureLevelRecord into the metadata log. The version used for this bootstrapping is read from \"initial.metadata.version\" in meta.properties. If an invalid version was read from the properties file, the controller will immediately shutdown.\r\n\r\n## kafka-features.sh changes\r\n\r\nThis tool is completely overhauled and now has sub-commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/kafka-features.sh --help\r\nusage: kafka-features [-h] --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER [--command-config COMMAND_CONFIG] {describe,upgrade,downgrade,disable} ...\r\n\r\nThis tool manages feature flags in Kafka.\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  {describe,upgrade,downgrade,disable}\r\n    describe             Describe one or more feature flags.\r\n    upgrade              Upgrade one or more feature flags.\r\n    downgrade            Upgrade one or more feature flags.\r\n    disable              Disable one or more feature flags. This is the same as downgrading the version to zero.\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help             show this help message and exit\r\n  --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER\r\n                         A comma-separated list of host:port pairs to use for establishing the connection to the Kafka cluster.\r\n  --command-config COMMAND_CONFIG\r\n                         Property file containing configs to be passed to Admin Client.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelp output from the \"upgrades\" sub-command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/kafka-features.sh upgrade --help\r\nusage: kafka-features --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER upgrade [-h] [--feature FEATURE] [--version VERSION] [--release RELEASE] [--dry-run]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help             show this help message and exit\r\n  --dry-run              Perform a dry-run of this upgrade operation.\r\n\r\nUpgrade specific features:\r\n  --feature FEATURE      A feature flag to upgrade. This option may be repeated for upgrading multiple feature flags.\r\n  --version VERSION      The version to upgrade to.\r\n\r\nUpgrade to feature level defined for a given release:\r\n  --release RELEASE\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefer to [KIP-778](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-778%3A+KRaft+Upgrades) for more details on the new command structure.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading metadata.version\r\nThis PR only includes support for upgrading the metadata.version, not downgrading. An upgrade is performed using the \"kafka-features.sh\" tool and sends an UpdateFeature request to the controller (via a broker).\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/kafka-features.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 upgrade --feature metadata.version --version 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the controller handles this request, it verifies the new version and then commits a FeatureLevelRecord. A new FeatureLevelListener interface on the controller can be registered with FeatureControlManager for components which need to react to changes in the metadata.version. For now, the only use case is updating the internal state of QuorumControl to reflect the new version.\r\n\r\nBrokers will see the new metadata.version once the FeatureLevelRecord has been replicated by the broker's quorum peer. The broker has a similar MetadataVersionChangeListener which is not currently used. We may want to remove this until we have a use

the moment, the `NetworkClient` will remain stuck in the `CHECKING_API_VERSIONS` state forever if the `Channel` does not become ready.

With this, the connection will timeout if the `Channel` does not become ready within the connection setup timeout.

KRaft does not support setting BROKER_LOGGER configs (it always fails.) Additionally, there are several bugs in the handling of BROKER configs. They are not properly validated on the forwarding broker, and the way we apply them is buggy as well. This PR fixes those issues.\r\n\r\nKafkaApis: add support for doing validation and log4j processing on the forwarding broker. This involves breaking the config request apart and forwarding only part of it. Adjust KafkaApisTest to test the new behavior, rather than expecting forwarding of the full request.\r\n\r\nMetadataSupport: remove MetadataSupport#controllerId since it duplicates the functionality of MetadataCache#controllerId. Add support for getResourceConfig and maybeForward.\r\n\r\nControllerApis: log an error message if the handler throws an exception, just like we do in KafkaApis.\r\n\r\nControllerConfigurationValidator: add JavaDoc.\r\n\r\nMove some functions that don't involve ZK from ZkAdminManager to DynamicConfigManager. Move some validation out of ZkAdminManager and into a new class, ConfigAdminManager, which is not tied to ZK.\r\n\r\nForwardingManager: add support for sending new requests, rather than just forwarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nBrokerMetadataPublisher: do not try to apply dynamic configurations for brokers other than the current one. Log an INFO message when applying a new dynamic config, like we do in ZK mode. Also, invoke reloadUpdatedFilesWithoutConfigChange when applying a new non-default BROKER config.\r\n\r\nQuorumController: fix a bug in ConfigResourceExistenceChecker which prevented cluster configs from being set. Add a test for this class.\r\n\r\nRename DynamicConfigManager to ZkConfigManager, since it is responsible for managing configurations in ZK.\r\n\r\nFix the handling of cluster configs in ZkConfigRepository.\r\n\r\nFix the a bug which prevented dynamically reconfiguring the log cleaner in KRaft mode. We were checking whether the cleaner was null prior to invoking LogManager#startup, which caused the cleaner to always be null.","created_at":"2022-01-07T19:16:01Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T03:14:17Z","closed_at":"2022-01-22T00:00:22Z","merged_at":"2022-01-22T00:00:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"68a19539cf1fcd86787960d0010b672d0d611b91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e435471c8014acdcaf9054ad76e49462f730751c","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-13552_dynamic_log4j","ref":"KAFKA-13552_dynamic_log4j","sha":"e435471c8014acdcaf9054ad76e49462f730751c","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

when using KRaft mode, users still have to have an Apache ZooKeeper instance if they want to use AclAuthorizer. We should have a built-in Authorizer for KRaft mode that does not depend on ZooKeeper. This PR introduces such an authorizer, called StandardAuthorizer. See KIP-801 for a full description of the new Authorizer design.\r\n\r\nAuthorizer.java: add aclCount API as described in KIP-801. StandardAuthorizer is currently the only authorizer that implements it, but eventually we may implement it for AclAuthorizer and others as well.\r\n\r\nControllerApis.scala: fix a bug where createPartitions was authorized using CREATE on the topic resource rather than ALTER on the topic resource as it should have been.\r\n\r\nQuorumTestHarness: rename the controller endpoint to CONTROLLER for consistency (the brokers already called it that). This is relevant in AuthorizerIntegrationTest where we are examining endpoint names. Also add the controllerServers call.\r\n\r\nTestUtils.scala: adapt the ACL functions to be usable from KRaft, by ensuring that they use the Authorizer from the current active controller.\r\n\r\nBrokerMetadataPublisher.scala: add broker-side ACL application logic.\r\n\r\nController.java: add ACL APIs. Also add a findAllTopicIds API in order to make junit tests that use KafkaServerTestHarness#getTopicNames and KafkaServerTestHarness#getTopicIds work smoothly.\r\n\r\nAuthorizerIntegrationTest.scala: convert over testAuthorizationWithTopicExisting (more to come soon)\r\n\r\nQuorumController.java: add logic for replaying ACL-based records. This means storing them in the new AclControlManager object, and integrating them into controller snapshots. It also means applying the changes in the Authorizer, if one is configured. In renounce, when reverting to a snapshot, also set newBytesSinceLastSnapshot to 0.\r\n\r\nThere are a few follow-up items not in this PR. One is actually creating the new acl count metric. Another is implementing the \"start after we reach the high water mark\" authorizer logic. Also, this doesn't implement the new busy error code. Finally, we need to implement
