`couch_replicator_httpc:setup/1`, if the URL contains basic auth\ncredentials, the replicator now removes those credentials from the URL\nand inserts them into a new ets table, whose identifier is stored in the\nreturned `httpdb` record in a new field named `credentials`.\n\nThen, if during replication there's a HTTP status code 401, the\nreplicator does a POST-request to the remote DB's `/_session` endpoint,\nin which the request body contains the user name and password from the\nbasic auth credentials stored in the ets table.  If that request is\nsuccessful, the session cookie is inserted into the ets table together\nwith the current timestamp returned by `os:timestamp/0`.  From that\npoint on, `couch_replicator_httpc:send_req/3` always retrieves the\ncookie from the ets table and sets it as value in the \"Cookie\" request\nheader.  When a new session cookie is set, the cookie value, together\nwith a new timestamp, will be updated in the ets table accordingly.\nNow, after having started a new session, the request that generated the\nresponse status code 401 is repeated.\n\nIn order to prevent the replicator from wrongly starting a new session\nafter getting a 401 status code and then repeating the request again\n(and thereby causing an infinite loop), it is checked whether the\ndifference between the current timestamp returned by `os:timestamp/0`\nand the timestamp stored together with the session cookie is greater\nthan one minute.  A new session is started and the request is repeated\nonly if the difference is greater than one minute.  Otherwise it is\nproceeded as ever, i.e., the response with the 401 status code is\nreturned.\n","created_at":"2014-03-10T23:45:35Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T22:33:10Z","closed_at":"2014-11-07T22:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"205c3b149cd11a8fb27cad574bc1fc3745f2e752","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/85eb4b506d083c18e9e4298d7ff4fe5246da8508","head":{"label":"KlausTrainer:2069-cookie-auth-replication","ref":"2069-cookie-auth-replication","sha":"85eb4b506d083c18e9e4298d7ff4fe5246da8508","user":{"login":"KlausTrainer","id":230061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer","html_url":"https://github.com/KlausTrainer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":841124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NDExMjQ=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"KlausTrainer/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KlausTrainer","id":230061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer","html_url":"https://github.com/KlausTrainer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KlausTrainer/couchdb","description":"Mirror

is an improvement and fix on the current pagination. Currently the pagination doesn't work correctly when using startkey, endkey or any of the other query options. It also shows an incorrect value for how many documents are in the view query.\n\nThis patch is very large because pagination in Couchdb is quite complex and there are plenty of situations to cater for. This new pagination works quite differently to the previous way we had it working for a user. \n\nA user can set the number of documents they want to view on a page. This is not related to `limit` options in the query options - the limit option is an overall cap of how many documents to paginate too. A limit of `none` is possible and is the default. If the limit option is set to 50 and a user wants 10 docs per page, the would then be able to paginate 3 pages before hitting the end.\n\nAnother change is that the api url and browser url does not change when we paginate. That happens internally and hence the new addition of `urlParams` and `docParams`. This allows Fauxton to keep track of the parameters that the user sees and the parameters that the document needs to paginate.\n\nThe majority of this work is finding the right way to paginate given a variety of query options. This is quite tricky and we had to build up scenarios of different query options and then how to paginate with them.

removes client-side password crypto from the JavaScript tests.\n\nIn some JavaScript tests, it has been assumed that SHA-1 is used for the\npassword hash in user docs.  Those tests should, however, not rely on\nimplementation details of the user authentication hash function, as it\nisn't the goal of those tests to check these.  Furthermore, this causes\nproblems when a password scheme is changed, or a new one is introduced.\n\nThis work clears the way for solving COUCHDB-1780 (upgrade users\npassword hash on login).  It will prevent problems with tests that would\nfail because they'd be relying on an old password scheme when a\nmechanism for upgrading user docs to a newer password scheme

was processing the LESS files in according to the order in `settings.json` but then concatenating the CSS files alphabetically from the filesystem. So LESS/CSS was being written to compensate for the alphabetical order.\n\nThis fixes that.\n\nThis fix does, however, come with one caveat. It removes loading `*.css` files from the assets--meaning one can only use `*.less` files when creating an add-on. However, there are no known uses of `*.css` files in an add-on, and if there are, they can be renamed to `.less` and have the exact same result--as LESS files can contain just pure CSS and have the same output (thankfully!).\n\n@deathbearbrown @garrensmith this one's for you. :smile_cat:

this is so monstrous...\n\nIt's a heavy clean-up of the CSS/LESS classes and such. The prime objective was to get things focused on using Bootstrap 2.3.2 styles vs. custom stuff or ad hoc re-styling.\n\nThere'll be more of this stuff needed on an ongoing basis to keep things clean and more easily upgradable to Bootstrap 3 when that time arrives.\n\nThanks!\n\nReview Request: @deathbearbrown &

the changes proposed in [Jira 1956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1956) to allow chunked encoding of multipart/related requests and make attachment lengths optional. Also addresses [Jira 1685](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1685) to allow POSTing of multipart/related requests. The code for the latter was in [Pull Request 91](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/91) but that ran into build problems so I will close that PR.\n\nI'd be very grateful if members of the group could give the code a thorough review if you have time. To help out with that I will attach some review notes to the [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1956) to give an overview of the

the map function to be passed a second argument, the emit function.  Benefits as I see them\n- 100% backwards compatible, emit is still in the execution closure.\n- makes it possible to run views in pure JavaScript without having to use eval (e.g. in pouchdb)\n- allows emit to be renamed in the case of some sort of collision, the circumstances of which I can't imagine.\n\nI can write tests if this is something worth pursuing, though at the moment I'm having troubling fathoming the ruby wrapped JavaScript testing format.

use cases:\n- To easily hook up monitoring tools to a database.\n- To enable triggering compaction using an external source based on disk usage.\n- To make it make it easier for automatic replication/sharding orchestration mechanisms to make good decisions on how to balance/move data.\n\nThe last of these use cases was what triggered me into coming up with this pull request.\n\nCounter arguments against this pull request (that I can come up with):\n- Security: One might not want to expose the available disk space to the internet. Do you think I should make this information hidable using an option?\n- Dependence on a(nother?) system call when checking status of databases and/or indexes.\n- This information can be extracted using mechanisms outside of CouchDB, such as `ssh machine df -h`.\n\nI'd love to hear your

modifications.\n\nCOUCHDB-1744\n","created_at":"2013-12-16T20:11:51Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T20:07:17Z","closed_at":"2013-12-16T22:50:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9adc966bf33f6d9a2cecdb7c223684c2b5e7f8ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/1c344a9669f6b3b6bafeac82ddc29a52d3eccf18","head":{"label":"apache:1744-single-config-file","ref":"1744-single-config-file","sha":"1c344a9669f6b3b6bafeac82ddc29a52d3eccf18","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

set of patches contains a number of fixes for the replicator's processing of multipart responses. Most of the fixes surround cleaning up connections used for failed requests and ensuring that entire GET+PUT operation is retried atomically (as the replicator pipes the response of the GET directly into the body of the PUT). It also includes a much older patch to use the `latest=true` query string parameter when requesting document revisions, which was a bit of optimization from the CouchDB 1.0 replicator that never made it into the rewrite.\n\nCloses
