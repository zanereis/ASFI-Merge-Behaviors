I don't know Spark runner well enough for now to do the fix. But I suspect that the problem is due to the `withFanout()` support in spark runner. \r\n\r\n@aviemzur , can you take a  look at the test and do the fix? \r\nAs we need the fix to have the build pass and merge this PR, what do you think about forking this PR and do the fix there, I will merge your PR and we will put the global PR (test + fix) to review and take care that your commits do not get squashed?\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-24T09:22:48Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T09:06:34Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T07:48:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a2ba926bdfecabee23f95dcf25bbcad02ae0b05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b68f0c5c2b507db7b66ee451208c0e19071ad7fd","head":{"label":"echauchot:BEAM-2029-NullPointerException_while_evaluating_GroupByKey_in_Spark_Runner_in_streaming_mode","ref":"BEAM-2029-NullPointerException_while_evaluating_GroupByKey_in_Spark_Runner_in_streaming_mode","sha":"b68f0c5c2b507db7b66ee451208c0e19071ad7fd","user":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68310413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODMxMDQxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"echauchot/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot/beam","description":"Mirror

no longer a way to read/write a generic type T. Instead, there's `PubsubIO.{read,write}{Strings,Protos,Avros,PubsubMessages}`. Strings and protos are a very common case so they have shorthands. For everything else, use `PubsubMessage` and parse it yourself. In case of read, you can read them with or without attributes. This gets rid of the ugly use of Coder for decoding a message's payload (forbidden by the style guide), and since PubsubMessage is easily encodable, again the style guide also dictates to use that explicitly as the input/return type of the transforms.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax \r\nCC: @dhalperi

final step in this series of changes to BigQueryIO.\r\n\r\nNow that we support dynamic, value-dependent tables, also add support for per-table schemas. These can be set via a user-defined function mapping table to schema. This function can access side inputs, so it's also possible to set the per-table schemas using a map-valued PCollectionView.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes direct references to BigQueryIO.Write from the public PTransforms, as those transforms are meant to be usable without having an instance of BigQueryIO.Write\r\n\r\nR: @jkff
