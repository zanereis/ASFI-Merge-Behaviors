Proposed changes\r\nThere are 4 steps in colocate plan: join, agg, sort and set operation.\r\nThis is the first step.\r\n\r\nThe old colocate join can only cover the case where the child is hash or scan.\r\nIn fact, as long as the child's data distribution meets the requirements,\r\n  no matter what the plan node on the child node is, a colocate join can be performed.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #5589) and described the bug/feature there in detail. Later\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\ndocument is

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen there is count(*) function in query, we only need to scan the smallest column.\r\nFor example:\r\nQuery: select count(*) from (select k1, k2, k3 from base) tmp;\r\nOnly k1 which is the smallest column should be scanned.\r\nThe remaining columns (k2, k3) should be pruning.\r\n\r\nThis pr achieves this optimazation of column pruning.\r\nFixed #5409\r\n\r\nChange-Id:

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen a table has multiple partitions, each partition has it's own\r\nversion, the version doesn't represent whether it's newer or not. When a\r\npartition has a larger version, it may be considered as the latest one\r\ncurrently, this will cause incorrect query result.\r\nSuppose there are 2 partitions:\r\n```\r\nPartitionName | VisibleVersion |  VisibleVersionTime\r\np1            |            123 | 2021-02-17 23:31:32\r\np2            |             23 | 2021-02-22 11:39:19\r\n```\r\nPartition p1 will be considered as the lastest partition, and there is a\r\ncache before p2's last update time, the cache will hit and return an\r\nerror result.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.
