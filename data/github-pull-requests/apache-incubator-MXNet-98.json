Cleaned up pages to have only content related to API references\n- For C++ API references added links to doxygen (namespaces, classes, files)\n\n**Broken Links**\n- All references in MXNet docs will now point to http://mxnet.io instead of http://mxnet.readthedocs.io\n- Fixed other broken links due to re-organization of contents.\n\n**Others**\n- Added recommended steps to help users logically

#3504\n\nAdd doctest support for symbols (operators). Executing `test/python/doctest/run.py` will run the doctest. Currently we have infrastructure and examples for operator doctest. We may plan to add similar thing to NDArray operators if necessary (we might not need to because many of the operators are the same).\n### Guidelines\n- Language agnostic descriptions should go to the c++ files where the operators are registered. So that the description is available to all language bindings.\n- Python-specific doc and examples are attached to each operator by deriving a subclass (e.g. `FullyConnectedDoc`) from `SymbolDoc`. Other languages bindings could probably do similar things.\n\nThe doctest should contains **Examples** and **Regression Test**.\n- Examples: simple snippet showing how to use this operator in typical cases. For example, `SoftmaxOutput` should show a scenario for the default mode and a `multi_output` mode. I think the users mostly cares about the syntax of the call, name of the common parameters and maybe the resulting input / output shapes.\n- Regression test: complete numerical test for the correctness of the operator. We are not expecting the user to read those, but to make sure our operator does not accidentally breaks. Typically one can compare to a numpy implementation of the op, or if the op is super complicated, hand craft special cases for expected outputs.\n- Gradient check: we might want to add infrastructures to perform numerical gradient check for each operators as part of the regression test.\n","created_at":"2016-10-12T22:32:29Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T08:55:18Z","closed_at":"2016-10-15T21:34:37Z","merged_at":"2016-10-15T21:34:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"67613fa13f8211a4d80602f16c9d317895a03dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/976c200a31f8bc8270221b81c8dc0ed3ba987660","head":{"label":"pluskid:doc","ref":"doc","sha":"976c200a31f8bc8270221b81c8dc0ed3ba987660","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"037a598b052ac5f23c506ec45b75ad82c0823de6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

output blob. This is because hybrid data layout might be needed. For example, some of our RNN related ops now take `seq_len` as input. The `seq_len` will be a 1D tensor, therefore in batch-major, while the rest of the data for RNN will be in time-major. Currently the default layout mapper will decide the layout according to the name postfix. But the user can define their own layout mapper with a lookup table if needed.\n\n@piiswrong I tried the `crop` and `slice_axis` NDArray operator, but they do not work for this case as we need to (potentially) copy data from one device to another. So I'm keeping the current copy_slice_to and assign_slice_from functions.\n\n@antinucleon I think by default, the RNN IO should output time-major for efficiency. I also fixed the softmax out by added another mode (`preserve_shape`). But I guess a unified `axis=` solution will be cleaner.\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T18:57:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T13:26:03Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T02:54:02Z","merged_at":"2016-10-14T02:54:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"23bf60cab87ff0e4cf02deccdbc2ca9791d9d821","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5ac1117225527b121ea22dc83ad7d3198e4bf376","head":{"label":"pluskid:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ac1117225527b121ea22dc83ad7d3198e4bf376","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d97e3605af1088377a6ed5102bff24d3f0b83edf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

@piiswrong\n\nAlso other fixes in this PR, the optimization will trigger when sum of gradients takes inputs larger than MXNET_EXEC_INPLACE_GRAD_SUM_CAP\n-  identity function now do not compute during WriteInplace\n- CUDNN convolution can take kAddTo correctly for both forward and backward.\n\nThis optimization requires ops involved to implement kAddTo requirement correctly. I find some ops are sloppy at this case. Currently it is an opt out strategy and assumes every op support kAddTo by default. I am wondering if it is safer to choose an opt in strategy. \n\ni.e. add an attribute to ask each operator declare if they support kAddTo correctly and the optimization only triggers for those ops

implementation of Stochastic Depth Training with the Module API. I did not use fancy tricks like constant graph and re-pointing weights, because the prediction needs to use all the layers anyway. The speed on a single GPU seem to be similar to [the torch implementation](https://github.com/yueatsprograms/Stochastic_Depth) (they report 60 seconds, while we are ~50 seconds, but my GPU might be better).\n\nI did not observe good speedup by running multi-GPU, though. Maybe because of overhead of data copying between modules -- note each block is an independent module, so e.g. the 110-layer Resnet has 50+ modules.\n\nI did not try to use the exact hyper parameters as the torch implementation. Both the residual block and the skip connections are also slightly different. Will add final number to the comments after finish running. The progress up to now seems reasonable:\n\n```\nINFO:root:Epoch[127] Batch [100]        Speed: 1056.31 samples/sec      Train-accuracy=0.961094\nINFO:root:Epoch[127] Batch [150]        Speed: 1041.82

@piiswrong \n\nMxnet's CPU performance is not as good as GPU's. \nplease see #2986. @xmchen1987\n\nThis PR integrates MKLDNN into mxnet including all the major operations(conv, pool, lrn, bn and fc).\nIt turns out we can achieve 750+ fps for alexnet scoring and 280+ fps for Googlenet-v1 scoring with this patch in two-socket broadwell server and the backward also can benefit greatly from this patch. \n\nPlease review the patches then give us feedbacks.\nThanks.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T04:37:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T00:17:39Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T00:17:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16a10530f7953b37d2bcd6e2a3b82f0d5f5b7015","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/69bb411b9ea342af6f6841826e8f3c8fff41c4c5","head":{"label":"Darwin2011:mkldnn","ref":"mkldnn","sha":"69bb411b9ea342af6f6841826e8f3c8fff41c4c5","user":{"login":"Darwin2011","id":5976561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzY1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5976561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Darwin2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69428307,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQyODMwNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"Darwin2011/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Darwin2011","id":5976561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzY1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5976561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Darwin2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darwin2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Darwin2011/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
