Description ##\r\nWill be closed after running CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAnother followup PR to fix the Julia site build and unblock website publishing...\r\nSince the website builds so many versions, it does so in their own folders inside `/mxnet/docs/build_version_doc/apache-mxnet/...` and this makes it difficult for Julia to find when it's expecting the binaries in `/work/mxnet/lib`. After digging through the Julia source and testing a bunch of things I found that `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` doesn't seem to do anything, but `$MXNET_HOME` is what Julia is looking for. It then manually appends `lib`. \r\nUnfortunately, according to the [MXNet environment variables](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/faq/env_var.html) page, this same env var is used elsewhere to store models in `.mxnet`, not a typical `$HOME/incubator-mxnet` or what is often called `$MXNET_ROOT` in tutorials.\r\n\r\nUnblocking website publishing is my primary goal, not dealing with conflicting environment variables, so I'm patching this for now, but I think the Julia package should updated to use `$MXNET_LIBRARY_PATH` or `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` instead. \r\n\r\nMy test run used a test CI pipeline that points to my fork:\r\nhttp://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/test-website-build/\r\n\r\nThe \"successful\" run was here. It fails because there's no place to publish, which is fine. Everything else worked: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/test-website-build/3/console\r\nWe might want to keep this test pipeline around... it took me awhile to remember how to create one for

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces a new KVStore API called `pushpull`.\r\n`pushpull` is a coalesced version of `push` and `pull` APIs. `pushpull` however can send and receive the key-value pairs with just one network call to the KVServer, thus eliminating the need to send a separate `pull`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] PushPull API, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-16T18:16:43Z","updated_at":"2019-09-08T22:32:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-08T22:32:50Z","merged_at":"2019-09-08T22:32:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c67928ad387c09731e5d062827439414b6d4851","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708189887,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxODk4ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/KVStore","name":"KVStore","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":919645457,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTk2NDU0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C%20API","name":"C

Description ##\r\nTesting a quick fix to prevent errors when using TRT with models that use fix-gamma.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-16T15:14:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T04:42:52Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T04:42:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f12fc785311a545192a60b4ca79fa26977f398bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

I moved the logic back to `runtime_functions.sh` because having it in the `build_all_version.sh` script will break regular local testing.\r\n\r\nThis command uses this branch as a source, gets the new

Description ##\r\nThis provides the fix for the issue described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15548.  Thank you @vrakesh for your efforts detecting and posting this issue.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is that libmxnet.so can be built with MXNET_USE_CUDA and MXNET_USE_CUDNN, but be available on a system with no installed driver (or GPUs).  The absence of a driver can be detected by a 0 driver_version set by cudaDriverGetVersion(&driver_version).  This fix includes code that bypasses the checks introduced by my recent PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15449 for the case when there is no driver.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR optimizes Softmax implementation for cases where stride is 1 and the leading dimension is small (up to 20kB of data in that dimension).\r\n\r\nThere are 2 optimizations in this kernel compared to the previous one:\r\n - using of the longer datatypes for loading/writing data (so using up to 8B per read/write instead of e.g. 2B in case of fp16 I/O)\r\n - using persistent storage to reduce the number of memory accesses (previous implementation used 3 reads and 1 write, this implementation uses 1 read and 1 write).\r\n\r\nCompared to the previous implementation on fp16 I/O the new kernel is up to 4x faster.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nPR intends to add support for higher order gradient for `arctan`, `arctanh`, `radians`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `arctan`, `arctanh`, `radians`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `arcsinh`, `arccosh`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the

Description ##\r\n- Add conversion APIs for bucketing module\r\n- Add support for saving and loading BucketingModule from a checkpoint\r\n- Add support for loading BucketingModule from a dict of bucket keys to symbols\r\n- Add tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-13T02:54:15Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T21:01:56Z","closed_at":"2019-08-26T18:24:55Z","merged_at":"2019-08-26T18:24:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"acc074f2b8a425196d0d1c1f66022ab1738ad607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":770413511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzA0MTM1MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Module","name":"Module","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix memory leak reported by ASAN in NNVM to ONNX conversion of a constant.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fixed a memory leak in NNVM to ONNX constants conversion code. The `shared_ptr`, as written, does not call `delete[]` on a dynamically allocated array.\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nPR intends to add support for higher order gradient for `arcsin`, `arccos`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `arcsin`, `arccos`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\nI add the contrib operators into cpp-package.\r\nCurrently, `dim_t (int64_t)` could not be parsed. I'm waiting for the merge of [this PR dmlc-core#540](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/540).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nImplementation of numpy `identity` operator in mxnet.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add op `identity`\r\n- fix some typos/mistakes in doc of `zeros` and `ones`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWelcome @reminisce and others for

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add `tril` op\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWelcome @reminisce and others for

Description ##\r\nAs title, detected by running java examples with ASAN build of mxnet and scala jni lib.\r\n\r\nThe `cOutputsGiven` should be released after all usages of `cOutputs`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nNumpy compatible argsort with existing kernals.\r\n[Numpy argsort API](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html)\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nModify the `ArgSortShape` and `ArgSort` function in src/operator/tensor/ordering_op-inl.h to accommodate the following cases:\r\n#### Tensor types\r\n- [x] Scalor tensor \r\n- [x] Zero-size tensor\r\n- [x] Other tensor\r\n#### Axis types\r\n- [x] Default: -1, last axis is used\r\n- [x] None: flattened array is used\r\n- [x] Other integer in range `[0, input.ndim()-1]` or `[-input.ndim(), -1]`\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis is new PR dedicated to replace my last PR on argsort, which has messed up commits.\r\nThank @reminisce and @haojin2 for

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nAs it was described in #15464, MXNet with MKL-DNN gives a wrong gradient of a convolution with respect to its biases unless the gradient with respect to its weights is also requested. In the implement of convolution with MKL-DNN, only request for gradients with respect to weights is checked. It should be checked independently for bias.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Independently check the requests for gradients with respect to weights and bias of convolution.\r\n- [x] Convolution can give the gradient with respect to any one of weights or bias.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- No

Description ##\r\n- Added [np.logaddexp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logaddexp.html) and its docs for future rendering. Scalar calculation is supported.\r\n\r\n- Fixed zero-size tensor error in BinaryBroadcastBackwardUseIn (GPU version).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added [np.logaddexp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logaddexp.html) and its docs for future rendering. Scalar calculation is supported.\r\n- Fixed zero-size tensor error in BinaryBroadcastBackwardUseIn (GPU version).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The previous error case description: when one operand is non-zero-size (eg. shape of (1, 3)) and the other is zero-size (eg. shape of (2, 0, 3)), the backward calculation on GPU will raise a floating point error.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T09:03:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T07:13:33Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T07:13:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70a8d8ab97944d228c222ea26c5ad79e142de960","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bf4122d135a12e79d0530d041c37cd362853d0ad","head":{"label":"xidulu:logsumadd","ref":"logsumadd","sha":"bf4122d135a12e79d0530d041c37cd362853d0ad","user":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195962165,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU5NjIxNjU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xidulu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

non-zero-size (eg. shape of (1, 3)) and the other is zero-size (eg. shape of (2, 0, 3)), the backward calculation on GPU will raise a floating point error. \r\n- Please merge this PR before merging implementation for np.logaddexp, the similar operator that also depends on the BinaryBroadcastBackwardUseIn fix.

Description ##\r\nnumpy compatible [einsum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add einsum\r\n- add einsum doc\r\n- add path optimization for imperative mode\r\n- add benchmark\r\n- add forward and backward test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- support both explicit and implicit mode\r\n- support multiple operands\r\n- support broadcast\r\n- support 0-dim NDArray and 0-size NDArray\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n- [x] translate einsum_path into c, so that optimization can work in symbol mode\r\n- [x] take advantage of tensordot when it is merged\r\n- [x] support \"greedy\" optimization\r\n- [ ] support \"optimal\" optimization\r\n\r\nThank @reminisce and @haojin2 for guidance and review.","created_at":"2019-07-09T08:05:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T14:53:51Z","closed_at":"2019-08-15T14:53:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25b07fb7f41231406c2922996b1130540b10b75b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{

a separate PR for a new tutorial on usage.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15517\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background ##\r\n\r\nWhen developing new operators, developers need to deal with Tensors, TBlobs, and NDArrays extensively (for simplicity, we will simply refer them as “tensors”). However, there is no existing tool that helps developers inspect the value of the tensors within an operator, so it’s hard to locate the spot where the computation goes wrong. With that said, we can create a new utility that supports inspecting, dumping and verifying tensor values to alleviate the developer’s need to use hacky prints every time. This new utility will support all the three data types (Tensor, TBlob, NDArray), as well as both CPU and GPU tensors.\r\n\r\nSome related GitHub issues: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15198\r\n\r\n## Methodology ##\r\n\r\nFirst off, to support all three data types, we will need to first convert them to TBlob, so that we can base our new functionalists on one single class and avoid code repetition. To access the value of a tensor/TBlob object, the easiest way is to add some function, such as to_string(), to the TBlob class. Then, we could use shape_ to dereference dptr and extract the actual data from the tensor in a structured format. However, to preserve the integrity of the TBlob class, we would want to avoid making direct changes to tensor_blob.h. Instead, considering that all the member variables of TBlob are all public, we could create a wrapper around TensorBlob, which we would call TensorInspector, and we could then add our new functions to this new wrapper class. We could put this new file tensor_inspector.h in src/common along with a bunch of other utilities. \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TensorInspector {\r\n  private:\r\n    const TBlob tb_;\r\n  public:\r\n    // our new functions\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides tensor inspectors which are one-to-one with tensors, I also propose to have a singleton class called InspectorManage which is responsible for data sharing and maintaining locking between the individual TensorInspector objects. This way, we could control some global behaviors within each of the objects.\r\n\r\n## The Value of Creating a New Utility ##\r\n\r\nIt’s important to point out that there is an existing utility that helps print out the value of a tensor, tests/cpp/include/test_util.h, (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tests/cpp/include/test_util.h#L472). However, this new utility under discussion aims to start from the use cases of the users, who in our case are developers, and has more functionalities than the existing utility. Note: this new utility will use CAccessAsCPU from test_util.h for data copying from GPU memory to CPU memory.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Funtionalities/APIs ##\r\n\r\n### Create a TensorInspector Object from Tensor, TBlob, and NDarray Objects ###\r\n\r\nWe can create a TensorInspector object by passing in a Tensor, TBlob, or NDArray object.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Convolution-inl.h, Forward()\r\nTensor<xpu, 3, DType> weight_3d = in_data[conv::kWeight].get_with_shape<xpu, 3, DType>(\r\n        Shape3(group_, M, K), s);\r\nTensorInspector ti(weight_3d, ctx.run_ctx);\r\n\r\n// Similarly, we could do:\r\nTensorInspector ti(/*TBlob obj*/, ctx.run_ctx);\r\n// OR:\r\nTensorInspector ti(/*NDArray obj*/, ctx.run_ctx);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Print Tensor Value (static) ###\r\n\r\nWe could use `std::string TensorInspector::to_string()` or `void TensorInspector::print_string()` to get a formatted string representation of the entire tensor. We could see the tensor value in a structured way, the data type, as well as the tensor shape. \r\n\r\n```\r\nTensorInspector ti(/*Tensor, Tblob, or Ndarray obj*/, /*RunContext obj*/);\r\nti.to_string(); // print tensor\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-08 at 4 07 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/60848554-d8c06100-a19b-11e9-9fe0-23e79a7a371a.png)\r\n\r\n### Interactively Print Tensor Value (dynamic) ###\r\n\r\nDuring debugging, situations might occur that ahead of time (at compilation time), we do not know which part of a tensor we need to inspect. Also, sometimes we might want to pause the operator control flow to “zoom into” an erroneous part of a tensor multiple times until we are satisfied to move on. In this regard, we could use void `TensorInspector::interactive_print(std::string tag = \"\")` like a break point to dynamically specify the part of the tensor to inspect and whether we want to skip the break point. tag is an optional parameter where we can give the break points names so that we can distinguish them. A “Visit” counter would tell us how many times have we stepped into a break point with this tag name.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    TensorInspector ti(weight_3d);\r\n    ti.interactive_print(\"My Convolution\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 29 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013632-5325e800-a338-11e9-90e6-607f17d81495.png)\r\n\r\nAs we can see from the screenshot, we would be in a loop that asks us for command. We would be prompted with the Tensor info, <f Tensor 20x1x5x5>, and we could enter coordinates such as “0,0” to print only a part of the tensor. We could also type “e” for the entire tensor, “b” to break from this loop, and “s” to break from this loop and skip all the future break points. \r\n\r\n### Check Tensor Value ###\r\n\r\nSometimes, developers might want to check if the tensor contains unexpected values which could be negative values, Nans, or others. We could have a templated api `std::vector<std::vector<int>>TensorInspector::validate_value(const ValueChecker& vc, bool interactive = false, std::string tag = \"\")` where vc is a bool value checker function that users can define, interactive is whether you want to check the values on the go (similar to interactive print, refer to the first screenshot below), and tag is the name you want to give to the call to identify it. The return is a vector of coordinates (represented with vector) at which checker evaluates to true. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 34 20 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013773-fe36a180-a338-11e9-9a2b-5f11ccc7afa7.png)\r\n\r\nTo the developer's convenience, we would also pre-define a bunch of value checkers. Refer to the Enum below:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 24 41 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013509-c549fd00-a337-11e9-85aa-82b3947f6be7.png)\r\n\r\nDevelopers could skip wiring their own checker by using this API: `std::vector<std::vector<int>>TensorInspector::validate_value(ValueChecker vc, bool interactive = false, std::string tag = \"\")`\r\n\r\nThis API can also be used creatively to find coordinates where the values equal to some required value or fall in some range. \r\n\r\n### Dump Tensor Value  ###\r\n\r\nSometimes, we would want to dump the tensor to a file in binary mode, so that we could use, for example, a python script to further analyze the numbers. We could use void TensorInspector::dump_value(std::string tag) to achieve this. We would want to use .npy format for its compatibility with Numpy and its great load efficiency. A benchmark can be found here: https://github.com/mverleg/array_storage_benchmark.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 45 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61014145-e19b6900-a33a-11e9-986f-4ce8d7e1ca16.png)\r\n\r\nIn this screenshot, we can compare side by side the regular print (left) and the value dump (right). Even without formatting the dumped value, we can see it has a better accuracy.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 14 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013144-561fd900-a336-11e9-8f88-b7de4a4927e9.png)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"793\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 14 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013155-5d46e700-a336-11e9-8d8a-ec114a0e355f.png\">\r\n\r\nAs we can see in the screenshot, the output files are named \"{tag}_{visit}.npy\", where tag is the name that we give to the call, and visit is the visit count. \r\n\r\nTo load the file, we could just do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.load('abc_1.npy')\r\nprint(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 17 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013259-cc244000-a336-11e9-8564-a018041634f6.png)\r\n\r\nNotice: in interactive print, we could also do value dump with command \"d\":\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-10 at 5 29 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16669457/61013612-40131800-a338-11e9-9838-58808e7170f5.png)\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\nTo test or use this new utility in your operator, just include the .h file and construct a TensorInspector object, say \"ti\", as described above.

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of a larger effort of adding new functionality to MXNet that was compiled separately from MXNet. See [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Bring+your+own+Accelerator) and [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Dynamic+CustomOp+Support) for more info.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step that enables libraries to be dynamically loaded into MXNet at runtime .\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Dynamic library loading functions for both Linux and Windows to load libraries and access its functions\r\n- MXLoadLib that loads and initializes a library\r\n- A new Python API: mx.library.load that calls the new C-API\r\n- Enhancements to both the Makefile and CMake flows to link with the dynamic loader library (dl)\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following:\r\n- An example, showing how to write a sample library in C++ (mylib.cc) with its own Makefile, a unittest to verify correctness outside of MXNet (libtest.cc), and a test script showing how to load the library in MXNet (test.py).\r\n- A unit test that loads a precompiled library into MXNet and initializes it. It runs as part of the CI for both Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-08T23:30:39Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T12:31:23Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T19:20:16Z","merged_at":"2019-08-05T19:20:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"3112893f80fdda2c9d8f6832562146bec97de205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":919645457,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTk2NDU0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C%20API","name":"C

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n- add numpy compatible [invert](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.invert.html) \r\n- add a helper function for checking if input or output is integer\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add invert and its test\r\n- a helper function to check for checking if input and output is of type integer at ` src/operator/operator_common.h type_is_int`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- pass CPU,GPU test, pylint, cpplint\r\n- Thank @haojin2 for

Description ##\r\nSince the dmlc.ml domain is gone we lost our Julia docs (and other things). \r\nThis PR adds Julia docs to our regular website deployment pipeline. 💥 Links to the Julia docs will no longer go to a spam/malware website.\r\n\r\nFixes #15415 \r\n\r\n**Update**: It also adds a thorough [Ubuntu setup guide for Julia](http://34.201.8.176/versions/julia/install/ubuntu_setup.html#install-the-mxnet-package-for-julia). The existing one doesn't work. However, this needs more eyes and testing. I did get it to work, but after a ton of troubleshooting, so I might have missed some env var or some setting that is required.\r\n\r\n**Update 2**: I removed the separate Julia pipeline for docs. I needed to have its installation and config steps and it was duplicating things anyways. So since I had to fix CI, I went ahead and removed the duplication. That being said, sometime in the future it would be nice to revamp the docs build and have stages for each of the doc sets and make it so you don't have to rerun every stage of CI if one particular part of docs generation fails.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\nThe Julia docs site ends up in /site in the Julia API

This PR enforces systems that rebuild mxnet to have cudnn v7, and improves the error message for compiling against v6.\r\n    - We are accumulating stale code that references no-longer-supported cuda/cudnn versions.  This PR provides a means for cleaning out this code.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces both runtime and compile-time cuda and cuDNN version checking.  The compile time checks are based on new macros: STATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE(min_version) and STATIC_ASSERT_CUDA_VERSION_GE(min_version).  Example usage:\r\nBefore PR:\r\n```\r\n#if MXNET_USE_CUDNN\r\n#if CUDNN_VERSION >= 7000\r\n    <impl 1>\r\n#elif CUDNN_VERSION >= 6000\r\n    <impl 2>\r\n#else\r\n    LOG(FATAL) << \"cuDNN too old.\";\r\n#endif\r\n#endif  // MXNET_USE_CUDNN\r\n```\r\nAfter PR (given the assumption that we're now requiring cuDNN v7):\r\n```\r\n#if MXNET_USE_CUDNN\r\nSTATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE(7000);\r\n<impl 1>\r\n#endif  // MXNET_USE_CUDNN\r\n```\r\nDiscussion continues in the comments section.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis PR improves the compile-time message to a user trying to build MXNet 1.5 against cuDNN v6.\r\nBefore PR, only the missing library entrypoint is mentioned:\r\n```\r\ng++ ... -c src/operator/operator.cc -o build/src/operator/operator.o\r\nsrc/operator/rnn.cc: In function 'std::vector<mxnet::ResourceRequest> mxnet::op::RNNResourceEx(const nnvm::NodeAttrs&, int, mxnet::DispatchMode)':    src/operator/rnn.cc:179:28: error: 'kCuDNNDropoutDesc' is not a member of 'mxnet::ResourceRequest'                                                           request.emplace_back(ResourceRequest::kCuDNNDropoutDesc);\r\n```\r\nAfter the PR, the error mentions the library version issue directly:\r\n```\r\ng++ ... -c src/operator/optimizer_op.cc -o build/src/operator/optimizer_op.o\r\nIn file included from src/operator/././operator_common.h:42:0,\r\n                 from src/operator/./rnn-inl.h:45,\r\n                 from src/operator/rnn.cc:29:\r\nsrc/operator/rnn.cc: In function 'std::vector<mxnet::ResourceRequest> mxnet::op::RNNResourceEx(const nnvm::NodeAttrs&, int, mxnet::DispatchMode)':\r\nsrc/operator/././../common/cuda_utils.h:467:3: error: static assertion failed: Compiled-against cuDNN version 6021 is too old, please upgrade system to version 7000 or later.\r\n   static_assert(CUDNN_VERSION >= min_version, \"Compiled-against cuDNN version \" \\\r\n   ^\r\nsrc/operator/rnn.cc:175:5: note: in expansion of macro 'STATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE'\r\n     STATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE(7000);\r\n     ^\r\nsrc/operator/rnn.cc:180:28: error: 'kCuDNNDropoutDesc' is not a member of 'mxnet::ResourceRequest'\r\n       request.emplace_back(ResourceRequest::kCuDNNDropoutDesc);\r\n                            ^\r\n```\r\nThis PR provides 2 runtime checks and issues a warning:\r\n    - when the compiled-against cuda or cuDNN library version does not match the linked-against version, and\r\n    - when the library versions are old w.r.t. the versions tested against by the MXNet CI.\r\n\r\nI built the PR against cuda 9 and cuDNN v7.1.4.  Running any model will emit the warning:\r\n```\r\n[01:05:03] src/common/cuda_utils.cc:50: Upgrade advisory: this mxnet has been built against cuda library version 9000, which is older than the oldest version tested by CI (10000).  Set MXNET_CUDA_VERSION_CHECKING=0 to quiet this warning.\r\n[01:05:03] src/common/cuda_utils.cc:89: Upgrade advisory: this mxnet has been built against cuDNN library version 7104, which is older than the oldest version tested by CI (7600).  Set MXNET_CUDNN_VERSION_CHECKING=0 to quiet this warning.\r\n```\r\nI then upgraded cuDNN to v7.2.1 without recompiling.  The following additional message now appears when running models:\r\n```\r\n[01:11:11] src/common/cuda_utils.cc:85: cuDNN library mismatch: linked-against version 7201 != compiled-against version 7104.  Set MXNET_CUDNN_VERSION_CHECKING=0 to quiet this warning.\r\n```\r\nAs stated, the user can choose to kill the warning messages with environment variables settings.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-03T02:34:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T01:23:02Z","closed_at":"2019-07-12T16:53:59Z","merged_at":"2019-07-12T16:53:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a564bec3e2c0d8388da1e89d39851e54f055a31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":850777570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA3Nzc1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CUDA","name":"CUDA","color":"fc235d","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9ec6097965208b2f04e61b17036f7fee995401af","head":{"label":"DickJC123:cuda_cudnn_version_checks","ref":"cuda_cudnn_version_checks","sha":"9ec6097965208b2f04e61b17036f7fee995401af","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","

Description ##\r\n\r\n- Create a MKL-DNN specific user-level api `quantize_model_mkldnn` which combines fusion and quantization.\r\n\r\n- Enable `resnet50_v1b` quantized model.\r\n\r\n- Split `quantize_model` API into three parts to make it flexible for users to integrate quantization flow into their project:\r\n1)`quantize_graph`: quantize fp32 model to int8 model w/o calibration and return a collector for collecting calibration information in the next step.\r\n2)[outside api]: users need only add a few lines together with mod.forward for collecting calibration information.\r\n3)`calib_graph`: generate calibrated model based on filled collector.\r\n\r\n- Draft a tutorial to introduce **How to quantize custom models for production-level inference with MKL-DNN backend**.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @ciyongch \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

(except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files,

Description ##\r\nUPDATES:\r\nBased on the discussion below with @TaoLv , I have removed the comments for USE_BLAS=mkl in this PR because after testing we find that we can statically link MKL BLAS library by adding USE_BLAS=mkl to the make command line. \r\n\r\nUPDATES:\r\nI tried difference ways to build mxnet from source by hiding each or both of the two changes I made below, and found that only changing lower case \"use_blas\" to capital format in Makefile would be able to build mxnet with \"BLAS_MKL\". The other change, adding \"USE_BLAS = mkl\" before lines 137 - 142, would not make any impact for this purpose (although I am not sure whether or not this change would make impact at other places).\r\n\r\nOne thing to clarify here is that I used \"make\" instead of \"cmake\" to build mxnet from source.\r\n\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nI have found two bugs in the Makefile file and make/config.mk file in apache/incubator-mxnet package. These bugs might lead to incorrect installation of Mxnet with MKL library.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, I could not find \"BLAS_MKL\" in mxnet.runtime.Features() outputs. After rebuilt my mxnet with the following changes, I found \"BLAS_MKL\" in mxnet.runtime.Features() outputs.\r\n\r\nIn the make/config.mk file, USE_BLAS will be first set to \"atlas\" for linux or \"apple\" for osx by default as follows (lines 119 - 124)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUNAME_S := $(shell uname -s)\r\nifeq ($(UNAME_S), Darwin)\r\nUSE_BLAS = apple\r\nelse\r\nUSE_BLAS = atlas\r\nendif\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater, the USE_STATIC_MKL would be set \"NONE\" if users did not set USE_BLAS to \"mkl\" before the following lines (lines 137 - 142). ~~This would not be corrected even if users set \"USE_BLAS=mkl\" at the end of the config.mk file or in the command line.~~ (New test shows that USE_BLAS value, thereafter the USE_STATIC_MKL value, in config.mk can be overridden by adding USE_BLAS=mkl to the make command line)\r\n```\r\n# If use MKL only for BLAS, choose static link automatically to allow python wrapper\r\nifeq ($(USE_BLAS), mkl)\r\nUSE_STATIC_MKL = 1\r\nelse\r\nUSE_STATIC_MKL = NONE\r\nendif\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~So, I correct this block to the follows,~~ (removed this change for reason described above)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# If use MKL only for BLAS, choose static link automatically to allow python wrapper\r\n# Please Note: You have to set USE_BLAS = mkl here if you want to build mxnet with mkl. Otherwise USE_STATIC_MKL will be set to NONE. \r\n# USE_BLAS = mkl \r\nifeq ($(USE_BLAS), mkl)\r\nUSE_STATIC_MKL = 1\r\nelse\r\nUSE_STATIC_MKL = NONE\r\nendif\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Makefile, lines 247 - 255 as follows, I corrected the \"use_blas\" to capital form. \r\n\r\n```\r\nifeq ($(use_blas), open)\r\n\tCFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_BLAS_OPEN=1\r\nelse ifeq ($(use_blas), atlas)\r\n\tCFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_BLAS_ATLAS=1\r\nelse ifeq ($(use_blas), mkl)\r\n\tCFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_BLAS_MKL=1\r\nelse ifeq ($(use_blas), apple)\r\n\tCFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_BLAS_APPLE=1\r\nendif\r\n```\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis allows numpy branch to run with cython.\r\nCython is enabled in CI as well.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- numpy-compatible cython ndarray and symbol\r\n- enable cython in ci test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Thank @haojin2  @reminisce for reviewing and guidance.

your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `logp1`, `expm1`, `square`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the

Description ##\r\nPR intends to add support for higher order gradient for `reciprocal`, `abs`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `reciprocal`, `abs`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the same.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-29T08:11:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-07T21:05:10Z","closed_at":"2019-07-07T21:05:10Z","merged_at":"2019-07-07T21:05:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3ae30979989f488cd933c2fbb6416a4e187de9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `sinh`, `cosh`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the

Description ##\r\nThis PR updates the profiler tutorial to include a new section on profiling custom operators.\r\nThis is a reflection on my work here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15210\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here","created_at":"2019-06-28T21:05:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T17:26:05Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T17:26:05Z","merged_at":"2019-07-03T17:26:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d49445fcdc01102bea04e5dd83272f928d557bb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nTensorRT integration lacked of unit tests, we instead relied on output comparison of a full network which is not very pertinent, difficult to find the tolerance and not very helpful if it fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR have two purposes:\r\n 1) Add unit test for all operations:\r\nAs we only partition subgraph of at least 2 Ops we always append an identity to each output. we then compare to MXNet, using both TRT FP32 and FP16 computation.\r\n2) Fix a bunch of edge cases bugs that have been exposed by the unit tests:\r\n  - NHWC is currently not compatible with TensorRT\r\n  - Pooling is currently not compatible with count_include_pad and only compatible with pooling_convention Valid\r\n  - FullyConnected without bias cannot be converted to MatMul (as there should be a transpose before) for the moment we decided to remove compatibility, it is quite rare to do FullyConnected without bias anyway\r\n  - Concat is not compatible if the concatenation axis is the batch axis\r\n  - The dropout have to be only enabled on training mode (act as identity)\r\n  - BatchNorm with fix_gamma can have gamma != 1. so we force the value to be 1. when loading it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist
