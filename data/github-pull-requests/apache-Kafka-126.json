the `RegexSourceIntegrationTest#testRegexMatchesTopicsAWhenCreated()` and `RegexSourceIntegrationTest#testRegexMatchesTopicsAWhenDeleted()` a race condition exists where the `ConsumerRebalanceListener` in the test modifies the list of subscribed topics when the condition for the test success is comparing the same array instance against expected values.\r\n\r\nThis PR should fix this race condition by using a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` which guarantees safe traversal of the list even when a concurrent modification is happening.  \r\n\r\nUsing the `CopyOnWriteArrayList` should not impact performance negatively as the number of traversals, a result of using `ArrayList.equals()`, far outnumber (`TestUtils.waitForCondition()` checks for a successful result every`100ms`) the possible modifications as there will be at most one topic name added/removed during the test.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I updated the `RegexSourceIntegrationTest`integration test and ran the suite of streams tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

reproducing the flakiness of `DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest#testThreadPoolResize` (KAFKA-7988) on my machine, I saw that failures correspond to an NPE in one or more replica fetcher threads. This happens when the replica fetcher manager simultaneously calls `removeFetcherForPartitions`, removing the corresponding partitionStates, while a replica fetcher thread attempts to truncate the same partition(s) in `truncateToHighWatermark`.\r\n\r\nThis change simply checks that the `partitionState` is not null first. Note that a similar guard exists in `truncateToEpochEndOffsets`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

Reproduce Attempts\r\nI tried to reproduce this flaky test locally by running the `testCustomQuotaCallback` over and over again.\r\nFirst off, I had the issue where `GroupedUserQuotaCallback` would accumulate mutations and always fail. I thought it would be better if we reset the variables on every `tearDown()` call in `CustomQuotaCallbackTest.scala`\r\n\r\nAfter changing that, I ran the test over and over again. I commented out the lines after line 107 (` assertTrue(s\"Too many quotaLimit calls $quotaLimitCalls\", quotaLimitCalls(ClientQuotaType.REQUEST).get <= serverCount)`) since any changes afterwards are ruled out to have an impact.\r\n\r\nA lot of red herrings encountered while debugging. I think I managed to pinpoint the cause of this to a race condition in ZooKeeper dynamic config change notifications.\r\n```\r\nProcessing override for entityPath: users/group0_ with config: Map(request_percentage -> 1000.0, consumer_byte_rate -> 2000000, producer_byte_rate -> 1000000) 1551189456810\r\nProcessing override for entityPath: users/group0_ with config: Map(request_percentage -> 1000.0, consumer_byte_rate -> 2000000, producer_byte_rate -> 1000000) 1551189456810\r\nin UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges 1551189456811\r\nin UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges 1551189456811\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nIn updateQuotaMetricConfigs 1551189456811}\r\nUpdating metric config allMetrics.asScala.filterKeys 1551189456811\r\nIn this 1551189456811}\r\nRESET THEM (quotaLimitCalls.values.foreach(_.set(0)))\r\nUpdating metric config allMetrics.asScala.filterKeys 1551189456811\r\nOUT UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges 1551189456811\r\nOUT UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges 1551189456811\r\nAsserting 1551189457588\r\n```\r\nThis is basically the trailing result of the `user.configureAndWaitForQuota` call. That test code verifies that the quotas are set on the metrics (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2627a1be2cf5ef865fd1da0bc81680df9612655a/core/src/test/scala/integration/kafka/api/BaseQuotaTest.scala#L297).\r\nThe problem is that there is a race condition in between the code that updates said metrics - it subsequently calls `ClientQuotaManager#updateQuotaMetricConfigs()` (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2627a1be2cf5ef865fd1da0bc81680df9612655a/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ClientQuotaManager.scala#L449) which also [goes on to call]((https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2627a1be2cf5ef865fd1da0bc81680df9612655a/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ClientQuotaManager.scala#L496) `quotaCallback.quotaLimit`, incrementing the `quotaLimitCalls` variable we check in the test.\r\nI found `UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges()` to be the culprit.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWe basically need a way to guarantee that `UserConfigHandler#processConfigChanges()` has exited. If the test code's `user.configureAndWaitForQuota()` method had a way to do that it would be perfect. I, unfortunately, could not come up with a good way to address this.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that we could correlate the expected `quotaLimitCalls`. I see they had three different kinds of values across tests (with Thread.sleep enabled):\r\n```\r\nresetting Map(PRODUCE -> 5, FETCH -> 5, REQUEST -> 18)\r\nresetting Map(PRODUCE -> 6, FETCH -> 6, REQUEST -> 20)\r\nresetting Map(PRODUCE -> 7, FETCH -> 7, REQUEST -> 22)\r\n```\r\nPart of those are populated from the test code's `user.configureAndWaitForQuota` (2 request `quota()` calls for each 1 produce, 1 fetch `quota()` call.\r\nI can't exactly tell the correlation though.\r\n\r\nI brainstormed for a bit but could not figure out a smarter way to guarantee that this test passes unless we add a `Thread.sleep()`. We could potentially add a `waitUntilTrue(quotaLimitCalls(ClientQuotaType.REQUEST) >= 18)` and then reset but that seems even more hacky and error-prone.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we could simply not check `quotaLimitCalls(ClientQuotaType.REQUEST).get <= serverCount` or allow for some leeway there.","created_at":"2019-02-26T15:40:27Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T17:14:33Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T20:36:50Z","merged_at":"2019-02-27T20:36:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"f667f573ff12321f2913ccf17cdf9e9bcc97b550","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9e21360abcdfbfd2f1b405fcdace9dc0b7f54c49","head":{"label":"stanislavkozlovski:KAFKA-7940-test-custom-quota-callback","ref":"KAFKA-7940-test-custom-quota-callback","sha":"9e21360abcdfbfd2f1b405fcdace9dc0b7f54c49","user":{"login":"stanislavkozlovski","id":13639618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjM5NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13639618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski","html_url":"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"dc91ce58af941b822fbad3b560c35774130848f0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

the comments on PR-6307. Sorry for new PR, but one of the comments was to move the PR to another branch.\r\n\r\n****\r\nThis attempts to fix KAFKA-7938 and KAFKA-7946.\r\n\r\nI removed two tests:\r\n\r\n* testDeleteWithShortInitialization basically didn't check the result and therefore always passed\r\n* testDeleteCmdWithShortInitialization has no way to enforce that initialization is indeed short, and therefore sometimes FAILED because the group would be created before the CMD tried to delete it.\r\n\r\nI thought the tests had limited value relative to the effort of figuring out a way to make the timing work.\r\n\r\nI also fixed testDeleteCmdNonEmptyGroup and testDeleteNonEmptyGroup so they will validate that the group both exists and is non-empty before starting the test itself. I also added some extra information for future debugging sessions :)\r\n\r\nI ran the tests LOTS of times to validate, but with flaky tests, it is hard to tell :)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

attempts to fix KAFKA-7938 and KAFKA-7946. \r\n\r\nI removed two tests:\r\n- testDeleteWithShortInitialization basically didn't check the result and therefore always passed\r\n- testDeleteCmdWithShortInitialization has no way to enforce that initialization is indeed short, and therefore sometimes FAILED because the group would be created before the CMD tried to delete it.\r\n\r\nI thought the tests had limited value relative to the effort of figuring out a way to make the timing work.\r\n\r\nI also fixed testDeleteCmdNonEmptyGroup and testDeleteNonEmptyGroup so they will validate that the group both exists and is non-empty before starting the test itself. I also added some extra information for future debugging sessions :)\r\n\r\nI ran the tests LOTS of times to validate, but with flaky tests, it is hard to tell :)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

state handling between `NetworkClient` and `ClusterConnectionStates`:\r\n- `NetworkClient.ready()` invokes `this.initiateConnect()` as seen in the above stacktrace\r\n- `NetworkClient.initiateConnect()` invokes `ClusterConnectionStates.connecting()`, which internally invokes `ClientUtils.resolve()` to resolve the host when creating an entry for the connection.\r\n- If this host lookup fails, a `UnknownHostException` can be thrown back to `NetworkClient.initiateConnect()` and the connection entry is not created in `ClusterConnectionStates`. This exception doesn't currently get logged so this is a guess on my part.\r\n- `NetworkClient.initiateConnect()` catches the exception and attempts to call `ClusterConnectionStates.disconnected()`, which throws an `IllegalStateException` because no entry had yet been created due to the lookup failure.\r\n- This `IllegalStateException` ends up killing the worker thread and `KafkaAdminClient` gets stuck, never returning from `listTopics()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a unit test which reproduces the original issue (matching stacktrace) and verifies the fix.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

fixed a critical bug where replica followers would inadequately use the leader epoch cache for truncating their logs upon becoming a follower. The root of the issue was that a regression in KAFKA-7415 caused the leader epoch cache to be populated upon becoming a leader, even if the message format was older and did not support epoch caches. This resulted in very sparsely populated caches which the brokers would make use of when becoming a follower, resulting in huge log truncations.\r\n\r\nKAFKA-7897 fixed that problem by not updating the leader epoch cache if the message format does not support it. It was merged all the way back to 1.1 but due to significant branch divergence the patches for 2.0 and below were simplified. As said in the commit:\r\n> Note this is a simplified fix than what was merged to trunk in #6232 since the branches have diverged significantly. Rather than removing the epoch cache file, we guard usage of the cache with the record version.\r\n\r\nDue to the previous problem, we still had the sparsely populated epoch cache file present. This results in the same bug being hit at a different time. When the message format gets upgraded to support the leader epoch cache, brokers start to make use of it. This results in the same large truncations we saw in KAFKA-7897.\r\n\r\nThe key difference is that the patches for 2.1 and trunk deleted the non-empty leader epoch cache files if the log message format did not support it.\r\nWe should update the earlier versions to do the same thing. That way, users that have upgraded to 2.0.1 but are still using the old message formats/protocol will have their epochs cleaned up on the first roll that upgrades the `inter.broker.protocol.version`","created_at":"2019-02-21T09:26:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T22:56:09Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T22:56:09Z","merged_at":"2019-02-22T22:56:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"48986f380efa3ddfe3cc5fbaa1544d679fc04896","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/aaa4a352963294db81c011d5baf1afb101792595","head":{"label":"stanislavkozlovski:2.0","ref":"2.0","sha":"aaa4a352963294db81c011d5baf1afb101792595","user":{"login":"stanislavkozlovski","id":13639618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjM5NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13639618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski","html_url":"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.0","ref":"2.0","sha":"d072db1d67c59436bf65a192245f423e87399eda","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

change affects the JsonConverter.\r\n\r\nSome json parsers have particular requirements for field order in a json message. While this is not a part of the json spec and shouldn't really be necessary it is a reality for parsers we have on our mainframe. I have made this a configuration setting with a default of 'none' to retain the current functionality as is while giving users the option of enabling field order retention.\r\n\r\n3 new test methods have been added to verify the behaviour of the setting is as expected when not set, set to 'none' and set to 'retained'. \r\n\r\nTo engage the behaviour use:\r\n`json.field.order=retained`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

token refresh point could potentially be calculated incorrectly when the token was created far enough in the past, possibly raising an exception and disabling the client.  Typically this is not the case -- when the client invokes \"login\" on the JAAS LoginModule the token that is returned is not a token that has been \"sitting on the shelf\" for a while; it is generally a token that has just been created, so its start time is very close to \"now\".  The bug potentially exists for the case where the token has a start time far enough in the past such that the 80% point from that start time to the expiration time ends up being before the current time.  Even then, though, the minimum refresh time will generally kick in and cause the token to be refreshed after that minimum time.  The bug does exist for the special case where not only does the 80% point end up being calculated to be in the past, but also the remaining lifetime (the time between \"now\" and the expiration time) is small enough such that the minimum refresh time and the minimum buffer time at the end cannot both be accommodated.  For example, if the minimum refresh time is 1 minute and the minimum buffer time at the end is 5 minutes, but the token expires in less than 6 minutes -- then the bug condition can occur if the token start time is in the past.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ron Dagostino

[KIP-437](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-437%3A+Custom+replacement+for+MaskField+SMT), which has been adopted.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nAllow literal value for MaskField SMT instead of null-masking for masking out:\r\n- IP address, \r\n- SSN\r\n- other personally identifiable information (PII)\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe existing `org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField` SMT always uses the null value for field masking. This PR introduces additional config param `replacement`, which will be applied to all fields in `fields` list. In such a way you can mask any string or numeric values with any literal of your choice.\r\n\r\n_example config:_\r\n```\r\ntransforms=SSNMask,IPMask\r\ntransforms.SSNMask.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField$Value\r\ntransforms.SSNMask.fields=ssn\r\ntransforms.SSNMask.replacement=***-***-****\r\ntransforms.IPMask.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField$Value\r\ntransforms.IPMask.fields=ipAddress\r\ntransforms.IPMask.replacement=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\r\n```\r\n### Restrictions:\r\n- only numeric or string values are supported (no Dates, Booleans, lists, maps)\r\n- literal value in `replacement` should be convertable to the type(s) of the `fields` passed. Be aware of such situations:\r\n\r\n_if the replacement cannot be converted to some of the fields passed, the exception will be thrown_\r\n```\r\ntransforms=FieldMask\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField$Value\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.fields=ssn,age\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.replacement=string_replacement\r\n```\r\n\r\n_if the replacement can be converted to all of the fields types, but fields types are different, replacement will be converted to the desired types_:\r\n```\r\ntransforms=FieldMask\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField$Value\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.fields=name,age\r\ntransforms.FieldMask.replacement=12\r\n```\r\n\r\nMasking lists, maps and Booleans with custom value seems useless.\r\nMasking dates is not very flexible in `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Values`. Custom parser is also a needless solution, until it is not required by the user.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Unit tests are provided, custom doc testing was held\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

`org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ExampleConnectIntegrationTest` is executed before `RestServerTest`).\r\nTo prevent this, we have to either make sure we set `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true` as early as possible or do not rely on this system property at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test dependency on `httpcomponents-client` which doesn't depend on `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders` system property. Thus none of existing tests should interfere with `RestServerTest`.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

PR adds support for re-using a `KGroupedStream` or `KGroupedTable object after executing an aggregation operation with a named repartition topic. \r\n\r\n`KGroupedStream` example\r\n```java\r\nfinal KGroupedStream<String, String> kGroupedStream = builder.<String, String>stream(\"topic\").selectKey((k, v) -> k).groupByKey(as(\"grouping\"));\r\nkGroupedStream.windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMillis(10L))).count().toStream().to(\"output-one\");\r\nkGroupedStream.windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMillis(30L))).count().toStream().to(\"output-two\");\r\n```\r\n`KGroupedTable` example\r\n```java\r\nfinal KGroupedTable<String, String> kGroupedTable = builder.<String, String>table(\"topic\").groupBy(KeyValue::pair, Grouped.as(\"grouping\"));\r\n kGroupedTable.count().toStream().to(\"output-count\");\r\n kGroupedTable.reduce((v, v2) -> v2, (v, v2) -> v2).toStream().to(\"output-reduce\");\r\n```\r\nThis approach will not cause any compatibility issues for two reasons\r\n\r\n1. Aggregations requiring repartitioning without naming the repartition topic maintain the same topology structure, which is the default mode today.  So by not reusing the repartition graph node, the numbering and structure of the topology remains the same.\r\n2. Aggregations where the repartition topic _*is*_ named, it is not possible at the moment to re-use either the `KGroupedStream` or `KGroupedTable` object as Kafka Streams throws an `InvalidTopologyException` when building the topology. Hence you can't even deploy the application.\r\n\r\nI've added unit tests for each case and ran our existing suite of streams tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-13T21:20:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T01:09:35Z","closed_at":"2019-02-17T02:43:49Z","merged_at":"2019-02-17T02:43:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"247ccd7ac97234d91ba8c6c58a54272e89cd81b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8271bb21f388cef4cb46d384d9bfef8491b63a19","head":{"label":"bbejeck:KAFKA-7758_resuse_KGroupStreamWithNamedRepartitionTopics","ref":"KAFKA-7758_resuse_KGroupStreamWithNamedRepartitionTopics","sha":"8271bb21f388cef4cb46d384d9bfef8491b63a19","user":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42054236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1NDIzNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"bbejeck/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck/kafka","description":"Mirror

is the fix. Since `inter.broker.protocol.version` is defined in `KafkaConfig` (not `LogConfig`), I concluded that `ProduceRequest` validation routine is the best place for check. (I first thought that `LogValidator` would be the right place, but it required too many parameter passing. So I rejected that approach.)\r\n\r\nHere are the details:\r\n\r\n1. Add `Optional<Integer> interBrokerProtocolVersion` to `ProduceRequest#validateRecords.`\r\n2. Disallow zstd compressed `MemoryRecords` if `inter.broker.protocol.version` < 2.1 (i.e., `ApiVersion.id` = 17).\r\n3. Add `ProduceRequest#validateRecords(short, MemoryRecords)` for backward compatibility.\r\n4.

an older message format is in use, we should disable the leader epoch cache so that we resort to truncation by high watermark. Previously we updated the cache for all versions when a broker became leader for a partition. This can cause large and unnecessary truncations after leader changes because we relied on the presence of _any_ cached epoch in order to tell whether to use the improved truncation logic possible with the OffsetsForLeaderEpoch API.\r\n\r\nNote this is a simplified fix than what was merged to trunk in #6232 since the branches have diverged significantly.
