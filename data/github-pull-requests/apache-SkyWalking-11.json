This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.5</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/5cba162a5d93f8df786d828621019e03e50edb4f\"><code>5cba162</code></a> Updating version.json and repo version numbers to: 19.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b0e8e607dc1ace17c823276d3384eeda775bbd76\"><code>b0e8e60</code></a> Refactoring Java parsing (3.19.x) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10667\">#10667</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/30b9f88f003f327822b3032a844cff1ad23ec487\"><code>30b9f88</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10603\">#10603</a> from deannagarcia/3.19.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/8cccc0dbdd7561b184a8231f4886e630b7221b0b\"><code>8cccc0d</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10606\">#10606</a> from deannagarcia/buildZip19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/0661cc41dc65545938515f7e3944e1b4ea4618e5\"><code>0661cc4</code></a> Use local artifacts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/184f584b0a1d7c3c22757084c721f503214bbcbf\"><code>184f584</code></a> Fix spelling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/9e8d5f10977397411dbe9bba9cb0c60c2c427b53\"><code>9e8d5f1</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10574\">#10574</a> from deannagarcia/3.19.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/8b17db185c09c0929a67f45adab9c1a50f285c1e\"><code>8b17db1</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10578\">#10578</a> from protocolbuffers/3.19.x-202209141437</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b1135aa41280dba9d61637e643ed97eab218acab\"><code>b1135aa</code></a> Update version.json to: 19.6-dev</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/23865cde2f142eb286a079fb048d332aeea7056a\"><code>23865cd</code></a> Make release script executable</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/compare/v3.19.4...v3.19.6\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java&package-manager=maven&previous-version=3.19.4&new-version=3.19.6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

The skywalking-meter-receiver-plugin will receive the meter data sending by go2sky\r\n2. The meter sysytem will process these meters according to the meter-analyzer-config/golang.yaml\r\n3. The meter panel defined in general-instance.json, the ui system will load there panels when you open the General-Instance dashboard and choose the Golang tap\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n1. Update application.yml to add golang in meterAnalyzerActiveFiles\r\n`meterAnalyzerActiveFiles: ${SW_METER_ANALYZER_ACTIVE_FILES:datasource,threadpool,satellite,golang}`\r\n3. Start your go2sky agent and oap server\r\n4. Open the  General-Instance dashboard and choose Golang tap\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n![example

This module is telegraf receiver plugin. It mainly used to receive, process and send telegraf's collected metrics, such as cpu, memory, disk etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\n-\r\n- Modularized the telegraf receiver plugin by Java SPI\r\n- Defined the telegraf receiver plugin module name, provider, handler\r\n- Made the configuration file to set different MAL expressions\r\n\r\n**Step**\r\n-\r\n- Collected servers’ metrics such as system load, cpu usage, memory usage by InfluxDB telegraf\r\n- Received collected `JSON` format metrics in HTTP messages by RESTful API\r\n- Converted JSON format metrics to Skywalking's metrics format by Jackson API\r\n- Sent converted metrics to meter system, did the aggregation and stored it to database\r\n- Queried stored metrics by GraphQL and displayed on Skywalking's UI\r\n\r\n**Attention**\r\n-\r\n- The module uses `HTTP` to receive telegraf's metrics, so users should set `[[outputs.http]]` in telegraf.conf file\r\n- The module **only** processes telegraf's `JSON` format metrics, so users must configure `data_format = \"json\"` in telegraf.conf file\r\n- The default `json_timestamp_units` is `second`, the module **only** process `second` timestamp unit. If you configure `json_timestamp_units`, `json_timestamp_units = \"1s\"` is feasible.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n-\r\nThe following screenshot shows the detail query information.\r\n<img width=\"1090\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79000735/190608100-7d9aaf1c-df59-47c4-ba39-7b8ecd31bce0.png\">\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-16T09:44:12Z","updated_at":"2022-11-05T03:07:38Z","closed_at":"2022-11-05T00:08:20Z","merged_at":"2022-11-05T00:08:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"42f3396b647f331a29f7a4deef427ba2fbbd284d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.

meter-analyzer and receiver-plugin respectively, this causes unnecessary duplicate API calls to Kubernetes API server, in large cluster this would be a problem, this patch introduces a module for Kubernetes support and make the calls unified/unique but interesting parts can register callbacks/listeners and when events occurred the interesting parts can be notified.\r\n\r\nThis should reduce
