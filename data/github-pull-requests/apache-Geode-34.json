After a recursion step within Compiled Select's evaluate statement, the distinct flag was lost for the outer query.\r\n\t* The solution was to reset the distinct state back using a temp variable to store the initial distinct flag value.\r\n\t* Also, in this diff a else part section was missing converting PDX strings to normal strings for comparison of distinct.\r\n\t* When we place this else section converting the PDX string to string for distinct comparison, we don't need to perform this check in the 'element' query function.\r\n\r\nRemoving the JPMC related configurations\r\n\r\nThank

NOT MERGE.  This proposal was discussed on the dev list and was unfavorably received.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes GitHub settings to make \"Squash and merge\" the only option for merging a PR.  The other options could be used to bypass our branch protection rules requiring every commit landing on develop to have passed required PR checks.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the language in the the PR template to relax the mandate to always _initially_ create PRs from a single, squashed commit; instead emphasizing to initially create PRs in whatever way is most amenable to review (such as separating out refactor/rename commits from the actual fix).","created_at":"2019-12-20T17:20:40Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T03:47:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-01T06:50:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfe2c8967f759f62abead7ee488e9c9baad962ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronlindsey","id":1781978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/e1994e12e50529e5d478178937badd6868180dfe","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-7609-disable-create-a-merge-commit-pr-button-in-github","ref":"GEODE-7609-disable-create-a-merge-commit-pr-button-in-github","sha":"e1994e12e50529e5d478178937badd6868180dfe","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercon

complained about a possible NPE in startManager(). There was no\r\npossibility of an NPE, but precondition-checking code was overly\r\ncomplex, and difficult for LGTM and humans to analyze.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that much of the complexity was due to the code checking\r\nfor impossible conditions.\r\n\r\nThis PR greatly simplifies the precondition checks, and adds a suite of\r\ntests for the startManager() method.\r\n\r\nAdding the tests required injecting several dependencies.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Joris Melchior <joris.melchior@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
