Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-27T15:08:43Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T01:50:44Z","closed_at":"2022-04-28T01:50:44Z","merged_at":"2022-04-28T01:50:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a97b7a36a5f78f69ffeaa926c2edeae3aefb139","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22/labels","id":7698821,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdXmF","number":22,"title":"4.9.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":151,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-21T13:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z","due_on":"2022-03-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/4a47fd1e33064a00f9793422d5f770d6811008b8","head":{"label":"123monkey:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"4a47fd1e33064a00f9793422d5f770d6811008b8","user":{"login":"123monkey","id":27878756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODc4NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27878756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey","html_url":"https://github.com/123monkey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171801116,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE4MDExMTY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"123monkey/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"123monkey","id":27878756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODc4NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27878756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey","html_url":"https://github.com/123monkey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/123monkey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/123monkey/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSometime, when modify last commit pr, squash them will be much clearer for review.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nadd squash and apache contributors guide in CONTRIBUTING\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-27T10:31:47Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T01:12:52Z","closed_at":"2022-04-28T01:12:49Z","merged_at":"2022-04-28T01:12:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"a492592d773721ec80d94ae7ee9e7af6e36f3737","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22/labels","id":7698821,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdXmF","number":22,"title":"4.9.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":151,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-21T13:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z","due_on":"2022-03-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b13220b9a2e6e2e1dafb1981d438dea669ccf047","head":{"label":"ferrirW:CONTRIBUTING-improvement","ref":"CONTRIBUTING-improvement","sha":"b13220b9a2e6e2e1dafb1981d438dea669ccf047","user":{"login":"ferrirW","id":42178996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTc4OTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42178996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW","html_url":"https://github.com/ferrirW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":466971396,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9VrBA","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"ferrirW/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ferrirW","id":42178996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTc4OTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42178996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW","html_url":"https://github.com/ferrirW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrirW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ferrirW/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\ntracking issue: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4330\r\n\r\nAdd a controller for ha-service, the controller is based on dledger.\r\nThe architecture is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58988019/164617255-a42bf7a4-2648-4d54-a2b6-b4b1048f6714.png)\r\n\r\nDledgerController 里面有几个组件, 他们的关系是这样的:\r\n- EventScheduler: 事件调度器, 内含 BlockingQueue, controller 的每个 api 都可以往里面投放 EventHandler.\r\n- EventHandler: 事件处理器, 是 EventScheduler 的调度对象, 定义了如何 run event, 如何将 event append 到 dledger, 如何返回结果等等.\r\n- RoleChangeHandler: Dledger role 监听器, 当 controller 变为 leader 时, 便会启动 EventScheduler.\r\n- ControllerStateMachine: statemachine 的实现类, 其只负责从 dledger 获取日志, 解码成 event, 然后将 event apply 到 replicasInfoManager 中\r\n- ReplicasInfoManager: Controller 真正的内存状态机, 其有两钟类型的函数:\r\n\t1.不会修改状态机的, 例如 alterSyncStateSet 和 electMaster 等, 这些函数会被 controller 所调用, 根据内存中的元数据, 生成一些 event.\r\n\t然后 controller 会将这些 event 包装成 eventHandler, 投放到 EventScheduler的队列, 由 eventHandler append 到dledger.\r\n\t2.会修改状态机的, 例如 handleXXXX (handleElectMaster), 这是由 ControllerStateMachine 调用的. (也即当 event 成功 append 到 dledger 后, 就会调用相应的 handleXXX 函数, 修改内存中的元数据).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Add a controller, based on dledger\r\n- Add some options in name-srv config\r\n- Add controller into name-srv, add controllerRequestProcessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

业务线程调用`AsyncTraceDispatcher#append`向任务元数据队列`traceContextQueue`添加`TraceContext`；\r\n2.  `worker`线程循环从`traceContextQueue`中获取`TraceContext`、并包装为任务`AsyncAppenderRequest`，由线程池`traceExecutor`执行；\r\n3. `AsyncAppenderRequest#sendTraceData`中将`TraceContext`转换为可计量大小的`TraceTransferBean`，并按照按照**topic+regionId**对`TraceTransferBean`进行分组、获取结构为`Map<String, List<TraceTransferBean>>`的数据；\r\n4. 将`TraceTransferBean`按照`maxMsgSize`进行分批次的发送，根据`AsyncTraceDispatcher#accessChannel`决定发送到`rmq_sys_TRACE_DATA_${regionId}`还是轨迹消息队列(默认为`RMQ_SYS_TRACE_TOPIC`) 。\r\n\r\n当前逻辑的问题是`worker`通过`AsyncAppenderRequest`对数据进行了不必要的分割`List<TraceTransferBean>`，在`AsyncAppenderRequest#sendTraceData`中对数据也进行了不必要的分组。\r\n\r\n## 优化思路\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"image\"

TraceDataSegment>`中，`TraceDataSegment`中保存了TraceTransferBean列表、数据大小和当前列表第一个TraceTransferBean的保存时间；\r\n2. 将数据保存到`TraceDataSegment`中时会判断TraceTransferBean列表是否已经达到 maxMsgSize，是则发送数据、并恢复`TraceDataSegment`的初始值；\r\n3. `work`线程每`pollingTimeMil`毫秒会遍历所有的`TraceDataSegment`，检查其数据保存超过是否`waitTimeThresholdMil`毫秒，是则发送所有数据、以此避免时间保存过久不发送。\r\n\r\n该算法的总体思路是在数据达到大小阈值`maxMsgSize`或者时间阈值时发送数据。可避免之前因为数据不恰当的分组导致过多的请求。","created_at":"2022-04-17T17:34:44Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T06:47:12Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T08:09:39Z","merged_at":"2022-04-27T08:09:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6e65a8054a60cb5c62f5ade8a9e3927cf157185","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":856511196,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTY1MTExOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/module/client","name":"module/client","color":"9d77ea","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22/labels","id":7698821,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdXmF","number":22,"title":"4.9.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":151,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-21T13:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z","due_on":"2022-03-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/8c72734c4bb481d5c952505c04004ae6c375def0","head":{"label":"dugenkui03:patch-007","ref":"patch-007","sha":"8c72734c4bb481d5c952505c04004ae6c375def0","user":{"login":"dugenkui03","id":18216266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18216266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03","html_url":"https://github.com/dugenkui03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"50e314eb8ada23283dcdbb261766183c90fd435c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin"

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-09T17:12:36Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T01:16:29Z","closed_at":"2022-04-13T01:16:29Z","merged_at":"2022-04-13T01:16:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"2897bbfba2d80d05aeb1041da31b89e2620b1ec8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/6a19470548260768a3a1e6618bd031f912e3d8b5","head":{"label":"gogodjzhu:fix-spelling-patch","ref":"fix-spelling-patch","sha":"6a19470548260768a3a1e6618bd031f912e3d8b5","user":{"login":"gogodjzhu","id":5836099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzYwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5836099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/gogodjzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogodjzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"ead6274b3e8016ee2fa75cf0dc201b5581ee7a34","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/roc

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n1. The current approach like below, will swallow the `InterruptedException` and rise an `IllegalMonitorStateException`. This problem will affect the ’exception monitor data’ and performance.\r\n```java\r\n            try{\r\n                try{\r\n                    lock.lockInterruptibly();\r\n                    // do something\r\n                }finally {\r\n                    lock.unlock();\r\n                }\r\n            }catch (Exception e){\r\n                // error log\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n> 当前使用方式造成的问题是：`lock.lockInterruptibly()` 抛出异常的话会仍然会调用 finally 中的代码块lock.unlock`、`lock.unlock`会抛出异常并被`catch` 捕获，由此造成异常监控不准确问题，并对性能有轻微影响。\r\n\r\n2. In `ProcessQueue#fillProcessQueueInfo`, if an `InterruptedException` is thrown by `#lockInterruptibly`, then a RuntimeException `IllegalMonitorStateException` will be throw from `fillProcessQueueInfo` because the invoke of `#unlock` in finally code block.\r\n> `ProcessQueue#fillProcessQueueInfo`中：如果调用`#lockInterruptibly` 时抛出检查异常`InterruptedException`、则会导致调用`#unlock`并由此抛出运行异常`IllegalMonitorStateException`并在`ProcessQueue#fillProcessQueueInfo`抛出。\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nDetails in the pr that refers to this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-02T07:32:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T05:52:43Z","closed_at":"2022-04-22T05:52:35Z","merged_at":"2022-04-22T05:52:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"531cdb0bed16b2f418dcf1aeaf474916f23adaec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/23/labels","id":7765001,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdnwJ","number":23,"title":"5.0.0-beta","description":"","creator":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":14,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-14T11:57:00Z","updated_at":"2023-07-09T00:10:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-10-08T01:59:14Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/04cc6b8911fdb6878fdf20bbacf73ccec9982cd3","head":{"label":"cserwen:pop_config_sync","ref":"pop_config_sync","sha":"04cc6b8911fdb6878fdf20bbacf73ccec9982cd3","user":{"login":"cserwen","id":46882838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODgyODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46882838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen","html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":429275692,"node_id":"R_kgDOGZY6LA","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"cserwen/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cserwen","id":46882838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODgyODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46882838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen","html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-02T02:59:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-09T08:24:16Z","closed_at":"2022-04-09T08:24:16Z","merged_at":"2022-04-09T08:24:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb9d6e62b96bcc349ef6ade64fb014567b23b968","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/4da0c782980c020a43fa9aa9032ac1d18599b828","head":{"label":"cserwen:container-dledger","ref":"container-dledger","sha":"4da0c782980c020a43fa9aa9032ac1d18599b828","user":{"login":"cserwen","id":46882838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODgyODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46882838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen","html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":429275692,"node_id":"R_kgDOGZY6LA","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"cserwen/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cserwen","id":46882838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODgyODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46882838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen","html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-01T01:19:47Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T00:09:35Z","closed_at":"2022-04-05T00:09:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a9da9b30eff262a97aa3dbe8b2ca10278313bb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/17fde7ef627c14eb1e68192f442e098379c54186","head":{"label":"Oliverwqcwrw:develop-fix-modifier-order-1","ref":"develop-fix-modifier-order-1","sha":"17fde7ef627c14eb1e68192f442e098379c54186","user":{"login":"Oliverwqcwrw","id":31796988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzk2OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31796988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw","html_url":"https://github.com/Oliverwqcwrw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469987741,"node_id":"R_kgDOHANxnQ","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"Oliverwqcwrw/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Oliverwqcwrw","id":31796988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzk2OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31796988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw","html_url":"https://github.com/Oliverwqcwrw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oliverwqcwrw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Oliverwqcwrw/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #4048 and #4049\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nset `storePathCommitLog` init value to `null`, return default value `storePathRootDir + File.separator + \"commitlog\"` if `storePathCommitLog` not configured in broker.conf\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-29T15:50:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T01:25:51Z","closed_at":"2022-04-01T01:25:50Z","merged_at":"2022-04-01T01:25:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3b67484b0ea3172cf0555e39efe36c0030c53b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":856511096,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTY1MTEwOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/module/store","name":"module/store","color":"bba4f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22/labels","id":7698821,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdXmF","number":22,"title":"4.9.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":151,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-21T13:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z","due_on":"2022-03-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/11686f08d7b01a31c96686733957986478df37de","head":{"label":"HScarb:issue_4048_fix","ref":"issue_4048_fix","sha":"11686f08d7b01a31c96686733957986478df37de","user":{"login":"HScarb","id":10664298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjY0Mjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10664298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb","html_url":"https://github.com/HScarb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406723133,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY3MjMxMzM=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"HScarb/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HScarb","id":10664298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjY0Mjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10664298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb","html_url":"https://github.com/HScarb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HScarb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HScarb/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-27T14:10:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T02:15:50Z","closed_at":"2022-03-28T02:15:43Z","merged_at":"2022-03-28T02:15:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c121565c3eb59d536edc54512624e420136d30e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/22/labels","id":7698821,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AdXmF","number":22,"title":"4.9.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":151,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-21T13:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z","due_on":"2022-03-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:15:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/872a13d543744a0cb9cf10671cdd89e0e1fe3f42","head":{"label":"hjl11:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"872a13d543744a0cb9cf10671cdd89e0e1fe3f42","user":{"login":"hjl11","id":52824850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODI0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52824850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11","html_url":"https://github.com/hjl11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":474638450,"node_id":"R_kgDOHEpocg","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"hjl11/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hjl11","id":52824850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODI0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52824850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11","html_url":"https://github.com/hjl11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjl11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hjl11/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
