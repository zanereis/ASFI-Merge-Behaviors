needed?\r\n\r\nThis will remove these tests to `Slow Test` job from `Other Test` job in order to balance the GitHub Action CI jobs. \r\n- `Slow Test` job took `1h 45m`.\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/3953535259/jobs/6769916752\r\n- `Other Test` job took `3h 8m`.\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/3953535259/jobs/6769916829\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and check GitHub Action jobs' running time.\r\n\r\nIn the GitHub Action on this PR, `sql - Slow` job has the moved Orc suites.\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to retry SASL requests. Will add it as a metric too soon to track SASL retries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are seeing increased SASL timeouts internally, and this issue would mitigate the issue. We already have this feature enabled for our 2.3 jobs, and we have seen failures significantly decrease.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests, and tested on cluster to ensure the retries are being triggered correctly.\r\n\r\nCloses #38959 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the `pyspark` REPL is initialized with the `--remote <url>` option,\r\nthe URL provided is logged out to stdout as part of the REPL startup.\r\nHowever, it may have auth tokens specified as query parameters.\r\n\r\nThis change is to print the network location, i.e., host and port, instead\r\nof the full URL. Since Spark Connect servers will always be hosted at\r\nthe root and the URL scheme is always expected to be `sc`, only the\r\nhost and parts of the URL are relevant.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSecurity best practices require not logging auth tokens to standard\r\noutput or any destination.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously -\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://foo.com/?x=y\"\r\nPython 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022, 08:08:27) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /__ / .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 3.4.0.dev0\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Python version 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022 08:08:27)\r\nClient connected to the Spark Connect server at sc://foo.com/?x=y\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow -\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://foo.com/?x=y\"\r\nPython 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022, 08:08:27) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /__ / .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 3.4.0.dev0\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Python version 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022 08:08:27)\r\nClient connected to the Spark Connect server at foo.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://foo.com:8080/?x=y\"\r\nPython 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022, 08:08:27) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /__ / .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 3.4.0.dev0\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Python version 3.10.8 (main, Nov 24 2022 08:08:27)\r\nClient connected to the Spark Connect server at foo.com:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by running the `pyspark` binary.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds a sorted version of `Dataset.groupByKey(…).flatMapGroups(…)` and `Dataset.groupByKey(…).cogroup(…)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing methods `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapGroups` and `KeyValueGroupedDataset.cogroup` provide iterators of rows for each group key.\r\n\r\nSorting entire groups inside `flatMapGroups` / `cogroup` requires materialising all rows, which is against the idea of an iterator in the first place. Methods `flatMapGroups` and `cogroup` have the great advantage that they work with groups that are _too large to fit into memory of one executor_. Sorting them in the user function breaks this property.\r\n\r\n[org.apache.spark.sql.KeyValueGroupedDataset](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/47485a3c2df3201c838b939e82d5b26332e2d858/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/KeyValueGroupedDataset.scala#L134-L137):\r\n> Internally, the implementation will spill to disk if any given group is too large to fit into\r\n> memory.  However, users must take care to avoid materializing the whole iterator for a group\r\n> (for example, by calling `toList`) unless they are sure that this is possible given the memory\r\n> constraints of their cluster.\r\n\r\nThe implementations of `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapGroups` and `KeyValueGroupedDataset.cogroup` already sort each partition according to the group key. By additionally sorting by some data columns, the iterator can be guaranteed to provide some order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapSortedGroups` and `KeyValueGroupedDataset.cogroupSorted`, which guarantees order of group iterators.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests have been added to `DatasetSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR includes two JIRA tickets below:\r\n\r\nSPARK-42082: This PR proposes to add `PySparkValueError` and `PySparkTypeError` to migrate the existing `ValueError` and `TypeError` into PySpark error framework.\r\n\r\nSPARK-41598: This PR also migrate the errors from `pyspark/sql/functions.py` into error class by using `PySparkValueError` and `PySparkTypeError`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should migrate all errors into PySpark error framework to provide actionable and consistent errors to end-users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. It's an error improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded UT, and manually tested.\r\n\r\nShould pass the existing

in

Analyzer requires the `Count(*)` had already been converted to `Count(1)` in Parser, and for a given `Count(*)` expression, the Analyzer itself can not correctly handle it and cause correctness issue in Spark Connect (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41845)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to retry SASL requests. Will add it as a metric too soon to track SASL retries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are seeing increased SASL timeouts internally, and this issue would mitigate the issue. We already have this feature enabled for our 2.3 jobs, and we have seen failures significantly decrease.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests, and tested on cluster to ensure the retries are being triggered correctly.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38959 from akpatnam25/[SPARK-41415](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41415).\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Aravind Patnam <apatnam@linkedin.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Mridul Muralidharan <mridul<at>gmail.com>\r\n================================================\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces sasl retry count in RetryingBlockTransferor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously a boolean variable, saslTimeoutSeen, was used. However, the boolean variable wouldn't cover the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. SaslTimeoutException\r\n2. IOException\r\n3. SaslTimeoutException\r\n4. IOException\r\n\r\nEven though IOException at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2 is retried (resulting in increment of retryCount), the retryCount would be cleared at step https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4.\r\nSince the intention of saslTimeoutSeen is to undo the increment due to retrying SaslTimeoutException, we should keep a counter for SaslTimeoutException retries and subtract the value of this counter from retryCount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test is added, courtesy

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently with [storage-partitioned join](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1foTkDSM91VxKgkEcBMsuAvEjNybjja-uHk-r3vtXWFE/edit#heading=h.82w8qxfl2uwl), both sides of the join must be **fully clustered** over the partition values, that is, each Spark partition should have a distinct partition value. To guarantee this, Spark will group all the input partitions reported by a V2 data source on the partition values. The consequence, however, is that it can easily lead to data skew, when a few partitions have large amount of data.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduce a new mechanism which requires only one side of the storage-partitioned join to be fully clustered, while the other side can be **partially clustered**, i.e., there could exist multiple Spark partitions with the identical partition value. At planning time, Spark will compare the statistics from both sides of the join, and pick the side with smaller size as full clustered side, while the other side is partially clustered. It then replicate the partitions on the former to match the number of partitions on the latter. \r\n\r\nThe concept of this optimization is similar to the existing `OptimizeSkewedJoin`, and techniques such as key salting, but is applied on DataSource V2 level instead, and doesn't require AQE to be enabled. Unlike `OptimizeSkewedJoin`, however, this optimization is applied before any shuffle happens.\r\n\r\nA new config `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.partiallyClusteredDistribution.enabled` is added to enable & disable the feature. By default it is turned off.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider the following SQL query:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM a JOIN b on a.id = b.id\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile table `a` reports partitions `[0, 1, 2]` while `b` reports partitions `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.\r\n\r\nWithout the PR, Spark would group input partitions so that both sides will have 3 partitions `[0, 1, 2]`. With the PR, Spark will choose the right-hand side as partially clustered and match the left-hand side with it. Therefore, both sides have 6 partitions `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`. \r\n\r\nNote this PR currently relies on a simple heuristic and always pick the side with less data size based on table statistics as the side fully clustered, even though it could also contain skewed partitions. In future, we can potentially do fine-grained comparison based on partition values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous section, this feature can help to reduce data skewness during storage-partitioned join, when a few partitions are mapped to a large amount of data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new Spark config, `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.partiallyClusteredDistribution.enabled`, is introduced to enable/disable the feature. By default it is disabled, so the behavior should still be the same as before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

However, the boolean variable wouldn't cover the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. SaslTimeoutException\r\n2. IOException\r\n3. SaslTimeoutException\r\n4. IOException\r\n\r\nEven though IOException at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2 is retried (resulting in increment of retryCount), the retryCount would be cleared at step https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4.\r\nSince the intention of saslTimeoutSeen is to undo the increment due to retrying SaslTimeoutException, we should keep a counter for SaslTimeoutException retries and subtract the value of this counter from retryCount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test is added, courtesy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes `RowEncoder` produce an `AgnosticEncoder`. The expression generation for these encoders is moved to `ScalaReflection` (this will be moved out in a subsequent PR).\r\n\r\nThe generated serializer and deserializer expressions will slightly change for both schema and type based encoders. These are not semantically different from the old expressions. Concretely the following changes have been introduced:\r\n- There is more type validation in maps/arrays/seqs for type based encoders. This should be a positive change, since it disallows users to pass wrong data through erasure hackd.\r\n- Array/Seq serialization is a bit more strict. In the old scenario it was possible to pass in sequences/arrays with the wrong type and/or nullability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor the Spark Connect Scala Client we also want to be able to use `Row` based results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a refactoring so mostly existing tests. I have added test to the catalyst tests that triggered failures downstream (typed arrays in `WrappedArray` & `Seq[_]` change in Scala 2.13).","created_at":"2023-01-17T16:12:18Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T18:52:53Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T18:52:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"302d38a78fe0cd49a1c4d8028e44496bef28db3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac9183313b009b3609c6b009386e5dead4c87aa5","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-41993-v2","ref":"SPARK-41993-v2","sha":"ac9183313b009b3609c6b009386e5dead4c87aa5","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

thanks for your attention.\r\n     Caching is widely used by developers to improve performance. Reasonable use of cache APIs to improve performance presents a huge challenge to users . Many cache-related issues are reported in community. Even the built-in libraries(such as GraphX and MLlib) in Spark are suffering from caching missing. \r\n     We modified DAGScheduler.scala to enable automatic caching. We implemented a tool named AutoCache and help applications benefit from implicit caching with non-invasive user's application code. Furthermore, we did some experiments in cache-related issues(such as spark-16880.etc) reported in community and popular real-word projects (such as [BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL), [spark-nlp](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp)).  AutoCache is an automatic caching solution for Spark to patch missing potential data for implicit caching.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.WRONG_NUM_ARGS` and `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.WRONG_NUM_ARGS_WITH_SUGGESTION`from sub-class of `DATATYPE_MISMATCH`, and integrate into `WRONG_NUM_ARGS.WITH_SUGGESTION` and `WRONG_NUM_ARGS.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause `WRONG_NUM_ARGS` is logically not a part of `DATATYPE_MISMATCH` error, and duplicated.\r\n\r\nWe should use appropriate name for all error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n###

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr adds a new abstract `ReusableQueryStageExec` which is the parent of `ShuffleQueryStageExec` and `BroadcastQueryStageExec`.\r\n\r\nAdd a new query stage `TableCacheQueryStageExec` which is used to wrap `InMemoryTableScanExec`\r\n\r\nThe `InMemoryTableScanExec` has some issues in AQE:\r\n1. The first access to the cached plan is tricky. Currently, we can not preverse it's output partitioning and ordering. It's due to we planned the query with a un-materialized cached plan\r\n2. Miss updating plan info in AQE if the final stage incude InMemoryTableScan which breaks UI\r\n3. Miss propagate metrics in AQE since the InMemoryTableScanExec execution id does not map to current query execution\r\n4. The cached plan misses lots of optimization in AQE framework in AQEOptimizer. Ideally, we konw it's accurate statistics\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to protect NPE  in `SQLExecutionUIDataSerializer#serialize`  because `description`, `description`, `physicalPlanDescription` and `modifiedConfigs` init as null in `LiveExecutionData`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe submitted `SparkListenerJobStart` event may use an unregistered `executionId`, such as the `Listing leaf files and directories for ${number} paths`  job before executing sql job. In this scenario, `SQLAppStatusListener#onJobStart` will register a new `LiveExecutionData(executionId)` object with the default value(such as null description, null details and so on) and write it into kvstore. NPE will be thrown when data is serialized with Protobuf serializer.\r\n\r\nFor example, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR = /tmp/spark-ui\r\nmvn clean install -pl sql/core -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.DynamicPartitionPruningV1SuiteAEOff -am \r\n```\r\n\r\nthe test will success, but some error messages will be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39068 reused the `UnresolvedAttribute` for the `UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariable`, but then `Column('x')` and `UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariable('x')` are mixed in `lambda x: x + cdf.x` (since we use `x/y/z` as augment names); this PR adds the `UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariable` back to distinguish between `Column('x')` and `UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariable('x')`;\r\n\r\n2, the `refreshVarName` logic in PySpark was added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32523 to address similar issue in PySpark's Lambda Function, this PR adds a similar function in the Python Client to avoid rewriting the function expression in the server side, which is unnecessary and prone to error .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbefore this PR, the nested lambda function doesn't work properly\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces sasl retry count in RetryingBlockTransferor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously a boolean variable, saslTimeoutSeen, was used. However, the boolean variable wouldn't cover the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. SaslTimeoutException\r\n2. IOException\r\n3. SaslTimeoutException\r\n4. IOException\r\n\r\nEven though IOException at #2 is retried (resulting in increment of retryCount), the retryCount would be cleared at step #4.\r\nSince the intention of saslTimeoutSeen is to undo the increment due to retrying SaslTimeoutException, we should keep a counter for SaslTimeoutException retries and subtract the value of this counter from retryCount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test is added, courtesy of Mridul.","created_at":"2023-01-16T13:51:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T06:50:26Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T06:49:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87501defdf81c8434a9c0c7dfa0d37bae76e2ee1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a3e088ce7fb3278aa68180e25d8f6eb32f4c59f","head":{"label":"tedyu:sasl-cnt","ref":"sasl-cnt","sha":"7a3e088ce7fb3278aa68180e25d8f6eb32f4c59f","user":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325822007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU4MjIwMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"tedyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu/spark","description":"Apache

thanks for your attention. \r\n      Caching is widely used by developers to improve performance. Reasonable use of cache APIs to improve performance presents a huge challenge to users .  Many cache-related issues are reported in community. Even the built-in libraries(such as GraphX and MLlib) in Spark are suffering from caching missing.  We modified DAGScheduler.scala to enable automatic caching. We implemented a tool named AutoCache and help  applications benefit from implicit caching with non-invasive user's application code. Furthermore, we did some experiments in cache-related issues(such as  spark-16880.etc) reported in community and popular real-word projects (such as [BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL)).  Our experiments shows that AutoCache can guide applications patch missing potential data for implicit caching.","created_at":"2023-01-16T10:03:30Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T08:05:43Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T08:05:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39606/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39606/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39606/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f1a3f4aa0df97d438cd401bb1af96c3bb38ed1e0","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f1a3f4aa0df97d438cd401bb1af96c3bb38ed1e0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a better fix than https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39077 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38862\r\n\r\nThe special attribute metadata `__qualified_access_only` is very risky, as it breaks normal column resolution. The aforementioned 2 PRs remove the restriction in `SubqueryAlias` and `Alias`, but it's not good enough as we may forget to do the same thing for new logical plans/expressions in the future. It's also problematic if advanced users manipulate logical plans and expressions directly, when there is no `SubqueryAlias` and `Alias` to remove the restriction.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, we should only apply this restriction when resolving join hidden columns, which means the plan node right above `Project(Join(using or natural join))`. This PR simply removes the restriction when a column is resolved from a sequence of `Attributes`, or from star expansion, and also when adding the `Project` hidden columns to its output. This makes sure that the qualified-access-only restriction will not be leaked to normal column resolution, but only metadata column resolution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the join hidden column feature more robust\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is based on @coalchan 's  previous work of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35549 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1) method listPartitions is order to get locations of partitions and compute custom partition locations(variable customPartitionLocations), but customPartitionLocations is used for overwriting static hive partitions and file commits as well.\r\n2) However method listPartitions is much costly than listPartitionNames. For table without custom locations, we can use listPartitionNames to reduce requests to HMS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Introduced a new flag \"spark.sql.hasCustomPartitionLocations\". By default it's true to use listPartitions. Setting to false indicating to custom partitions hence listPartitionNames can be used.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1) created a nested partitioned table\r\n2) run the insert/overwrite static/dynamic partition cases such as:\r\ninsert overwrite table p1 partition(p1=\"1\",p2=\"1.1\",p3=\"1.1.1\") select 1\r\ninsert into table p1 partition(p1=\"1\",p2=\"1.1\",p3=\"1.1.1\") select 1\r\ninsert overwrite table p1 partition(p1=\"1\",p2,p3) select 1,\"1.1\",\"1.1.1\"\r\ninsert into table p1 partition(p1=\"1\",p2,p3) select 1,\"1.1\",\"1.1.1\"","created_at":"2023-01-16T05:43:37Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T00:17:31Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T00:17:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"833fb5e4fe92fcea563604e36a090ced7d4f97b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate errors thrown by JVM into `PySparkException`.\r\n\r\nHere is the full list of errors suggesting migration:\r\n- CapturedException (The parent class for every errors thrown by JVM)\r\n  - AnalysisException\r\n  - ParseException\r\n  - IllegalArgumentException\r\n  - StreamingQueryException\r\n  - QueryExecutionException\r\n  - PythonException\r\n  - UnknownException\r\n  - SparkUpgradeException\r\n\r\nIn short, this PR proposes to migrate all exceptions from `pyspark/sql/utils.py` into `pyspark/errors/exceptions.py` and fix them to inherit `PySparkException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause the errors thrown by JVM side (e.g. `AnalysisException`, `ParseException `, `IllegalArgumentException ` ... ) are managed by `pyspark/sql/utils.py` which is not very correct place to handle the PySpark errors so far.\r\n\r\nNow we have separate error package `pyspark.errors` which is introduced from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39387, we should centralize whole errors generated by PySpark side into single management point.\r\n\r\nSo, here I suggest that all errors occurring in the JVM inherit PySparkException so that errors can be managed consistently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this PR suggests to improve an internal error handling structure without any user-facing change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-16T04:59:04Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:44:44Z","closed_at":"2023-01-18T06:49:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fd1554e830a9ce97a30874e654ff0fe0296553b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport scalar inline user-defined function of Python(a.k.a., unregistered Python UDF) in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the user-specified return type must be of `pyspark.sql.types.DataType`.\r\n\r\nThere will be follow-up PRs on:\r\n- Support Pandas UDF [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42125)\r\n- Support user-specified return type in DDL-formatted strings [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42126)\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFeature parity with vanilla PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Unregistered Python UDF is supported now, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.range(2).withColumn('plus_one', udf(lambda x: x + 1)('id')).show()\r\n+---+--------+\r\n| id|plus_one|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|  0|       1|\r\n|  1|       2|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n\r\n>>> @udf(LongType())\r\n... def f(x):\r\n...   return x + 1\r\n... \r\n>>> spark.range(2).withColumn('plus_one', f('id')).show()\r\n+---+--------+\r\n| id|plus_one|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|  0|       1|\r\n|  1|       2|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nSPARK-41661","created_at":"2023-01-16T01:58:21Z","updated_at":"2023-12-19T02:22:44Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T10:43:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0872637a4dbb598c6f172f50f4f26fa1b10976b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39585/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39585/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39585/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5aebdf678fad15b692b466c1369f1d6766353f23","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:connect_udf","ref":"connect_udf","sha":"5aebdf678fad15b692b466c1369f1d6766353f23","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds check of spark.shuffle.sasl.enableRetries config (introduced by commit 2878cd84d5d5edcaa9bbc642c12d8c7f6f009328) before throwing SaslTimeoutException.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`spark.shuffle.sasl.enableRetries` has default value of false. \r\nIn `shouldRetry` of `RetryingBlockTransferor`:\r\n```\r\n    boolean isSaslTimeout = enableSaslRetries && e instanceof SaslTimeoutException;\r\n```\r\nMeaning, when `enableSaslRetries` is false, `isSaslTimeout` would be false as well.\r\nHence we don't need to throw `SaslTimeoutException` if `enableSaslRetries` is false.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds a new config that uses the `LargeUtf8` and `LargeBinary` arrow types for arrow-based UDF operations. These arrow types make arrow use `LargeVarCharVector` and `LargeVarBinaryVector` instead of the regular `VarCharVector` and `VarBinaryVector` respectively. This config is disabled by default to maintain the current behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`VarCharVector` and `VarBinaryVector` have a size limit of 2 GiB for a single vector. This is because they use 4 byte integers to track the offsets of each value in the vector. During certain operations, it is possible to hit this limit. The most affected way that we've run into this is during a `applyInPandas` operation, since the entire group is sent as a single RecordBatch, and there is no way to chunk up any smaller than the entire group. However, other map and UDF operations can benefit as well without having to find the right records per batch to not hit this limit.\r\n\r\nThe large vector types use an 8 byte long to track value offsets, removing the 2 GiB total size limit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds an option that can help users get around what currently results in `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, though this exception being raised is a bug that was fixed in Arrow and it should actually be a `OversizedAllocationException` in the next release which suggests using the large variable width types instead.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA few new tests are added. I also enabled the setting by default for a full CI run and all existing tests passed. I can add more tests if needed.","created_at":"2023-01-14T14:43:27Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T08:39:05Z","closed_at":"2023-05-29T00:05:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b23794376fbd3def33cc2409677e156309e4647","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/229c6e2276c534c7bacb987c0b8e6ea8cfccf52d","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:large-binary-vector","ref":"large-binary-vector","sha":"229c6e2276c534c7bacb987c0b8e6ea8cfccf52d","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding two new config `spark.kubernetes.driver.container.name` and `spark.kubernetes.executor.container.name` to override the default containers names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe are using CloudWatch to collect the pods logs, and we partition/group the logs by the container name. Providing a pod template for each job just to override the container name is complicated where we have more than 500 different job, so the best solution is overriding the default containers names when the pod template is not provided, or when it is provided but without forcing a container name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnsure that partitions of type string without quotation marks are not recognized as numeric types.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\ncreate table if not exists test_90(a string, b string) partitioned by (dt string);\r\ndesc formatted test_90;\r\ninsert into table test_90 partition (dt=05) values(\"1\",\"2\");\r\ninsert into table test_90 partition (dt='05') values(\"1\",\"2\");\r\ndrop table test_90;\r\n```\r\nbefore spark3.1 and earlier, it will generate such a path: `hdfs://test5/user/hive/db1/test_90/dt=05`\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select * from test_90;\r\n1       2       05\r\n1       2       05\r\nTime taken: 1.316 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\n\r\nspark-sql> show partitions test_90; \r\ndt=05 \r\nTime taken: 0.201 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n\r\nspark-sql> select * from test_90 where dt='05';\r\n1       2       05\r\n1       2       05\r\nTime taken: 0.212 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter spark3.1, it will generate two path:  `hdfs://test5/user/hive/db1/test_90/dt=05` and `hdfs://test5/user/hive/db1/test_90/dt=5`\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select * from test_90;\r\n1       2       05\r\n1       2       5\r\nTime taken: 2.119 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\n\r\nspark-sql> show partitions test_90;\r\ndt=05\r\ndt=5\r\nTime taken: 0.161 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\n\r\nspark-sql> select * from test_90 where dt='05';\r\n1       2       05\r\nTime taken: 0.252 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will cause inconsistent read data. After seeing [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30421](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30421), I think if the user does not know about this change and the migration document does not mention it, I think it will affect the data quality, so I added the parameter `spark.sql.legacy.keepPartitionSpecAsStringLiteral`, which will maintain the original effect when the parameter set `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf the partition is of `String`, but the value of partition without quotation marks, it will still be treated as `String` through parameter configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter the parameter `spark.sql.legacy.keepPartitionSpecAsStringLiteral` is enabled, the partition path generated by partition `partition (dt=05)` and partition `partition (dt='05')` is the same.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr moves `AliasAwareOutputExpression` from core to catalyst so both logical plan and physical plan can use it.\r\n\r\nImprove the code of replace alias to support multi-alias so we can preverse ordering with all of aliased, for example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT c, c as x, c as y FROM (SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nImprove the `AliasAwareQueryOutputOrdering` to support strip expression which does not affect result. For example `Empty2Null`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`AliasAwareOutputExpression` now does not support if an attribute has more than one alias, and `AliasAwareOutputExpression` should also work for LogicalPlan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nimprove performance and this also fix the issue in pr https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39475\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd
