calendar view was slow for frequents scheduled DAGs. Iterating the timetable with next_dagrun_info added a lot of overhead to the view.\r\n\r\nBy instead iterating on croniter, we can render the page significantly faster.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/23503\r\n\r\n~~First draft to discuss changes and precise UI requirements for this.~~\r\n\r\nSome of the changes:\r\n- Add tabs (Details & Logs)\r\n- Clicking on the attempt index would load the relevant logs (and not download the logs)\r\n- We keep a download button for downloading the logs of the currently selected attempt.\r\n- We add a button 'See more' or 'Details' that would redirect to the log page. (Same as the Nav button)\r\n- ~~Split metadata details into two columns for smaller vertical space~~\r\n- Checkboxes for full log content and text wrapping\r\n\r\n~~For the request URL, I can pass it into the metadata to be able to do something like:~~\r\n```\r\nconst url = getMetaValue('task_instance_log_api')\r\n```\r\n~~But then I have to manually replace `_DAG_RUN_ID`, `_TASK_ID_`, `_TASK_TRY_NUMBER`.

invoked, create_job now takes into account the provided `Command` argument instead of having it hardcoded.\r\n\r\n`glue_client.create_job` was very opinionated, ignoring the `Command` passed throught `create_job_kwargs`.\r\n\r\nIntroduced code has fixed this problem by giving preference towards user's input; case there's no input for `Command` we fallback to the previous hardcoded values, so that we don't break the API and have backwards compatibility problems.\r\n\r\ncloses #20832\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

implemented _recording_ of per-run templates, but didn’t access them in the log handlers to read the logs out. This fixes that. Since the template values are now dynamic, it no longer makes sense to set a static `filename_template` attribute on the handler object (and for ElasticSearch specifically, `log_id_template`), so I deprecated the attributes.\r\n\r\nNote that `FileProcessorHandler` does not use the dynamic template, and thus still accepts a static `filename_template`. We could potentially also deprecate that as well, however (and read from configuration instead).\r\n\r\ncc @jedcunningham
