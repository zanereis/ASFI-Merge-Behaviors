These are replaced by `ReadFromPubSub` and `WriteToPubSub`. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a beam.RegisterDoFn call for users to call on their DoFns instead of individually calling RegisterFunction and RegisterType for all parameter types, using reflection.\r\n\r\nThese registrations are important to ensure workers can process and lookup types and functions correctly. \r\nThis PR also lets starcgen key off of RegisterDoFn in addition to the identifiers list. \r\nOnly transforms/top has been adjusted to demonstrate, and a full go generate ./... pass run on the SDK to demonstrate that the code generator works in both modes simultaneously. In time, we'll remove the identifiers approach and require RegisterDoFn as the only way to hint to the code generator.\r\n\r\nThe extra changes are go fmt changes missed from other PRs and are benign.\r\n\r\nTODO in later PRs:\r\n* Make use of RegisterDoFn everywhere in the GoSDK and examples and document it as a best practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is the first notebook of a new _\"Tour of Beam\"_ section we want to create to help improve the onboarding experience for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to have the _\"Tour of Beam\"_ section to include links to all the notebooks we currently have, as well as to offer a new set of introductory notebooks to explain concepts gradually in an interactive environment. The landing page will come up as following PR.\r\n\r\nThis notebook covers the following:\r\n* Basic concepts: pipeline, `PCollection`, `PTransform`\r\n* Explanation of the `|` and `>>` operators\r\n* Basic transforms: `Map`, `FlatMap`, `Filter`, `Combine`, `GroupByKey`\r\n\r\nThe _\"What's next?\"_ section at the end of the notebook contains links to existing documentation, but will be updated once we have more notebooks for new topics.\r\n\r\nR: @aaltay \r\nR: @rosetn \r\n\r\nStaged: https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/apache/beam/blob/c81acf8e809bbca533fc0cae56d7ad96efaf8cb4/examples/notebooks/tour-of-beam/getting-started.ipynb\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds the ability for `DataframeTransform` to produce element-wise PCollections, via a new `UnbatchPandas` transform. The original behavior is still available, with a `yield_dataframes=True` option.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this, the PR also adds more robust support for converting between native Python types and pandas/numpy dtypes. Note that pandas' catch-all `np.object` type is mapped to `typing.Any`. This PR also closes BEAM-10570 - it adds support for RowCoder to encode fields with arbitrary Python types using FastPrimitivesCoder.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR reduces the number of skipped test cases in `pandas.core.frame` down to 36 (6.3%), and they are all due to issues with the test framework, not unimplemented functionality. The rest of the test cases raise wont implement (13.5%), raise not implemented (11.5%), or pass (68.7%).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Now raises WontImplementError\r\n- Series.memory_usage\r\n- `Series.__contains__` - checks for a value in the entire index. Maybe this could be implemented as a deferred scalar?\r\n- [`DataFrame.info`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.info.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Now raises NotImplementedError\r\nI'm pretty confident the following could be implemented at least partially:\r\n- `DataFrame.__getitem__(DeferredBase)`\r\n- [`DataFrame.apply`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.explode`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.explode.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.isin`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isin.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.assign`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.combine`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.combine.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.combine_first`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.combine_first.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.drop`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.eval`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.eval.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.melt`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.melt.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.at`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.at.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.count`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.count.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.cov`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.cov.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.corr`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.dot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dot.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.pivot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.pivot_table`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot_table.html)\r\n\r\nI _think_ the following could be implemented:\r\n- [`Series.reindex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.reindex.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.index`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.index) (deferred access and assignment)\r\n- [`DataFrame.reindex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reindex.html)\r\n- [`DataFrame.append`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.append.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### New functionality\r\n- Arithmetic operators for DataFrame\r\n\r\nI provided implementations for the following functions dealing with columns, but they're not deferred which seems wrong:\r\n- [`DataFrame.columns`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.columns.html)\r\n- `DataFrame.__contains__`\r\n- [`DataFrame.axes`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.axes.html) (returns `(self.index, self.columns)`, so it will fail until `index` is supported)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Dataflow |

support.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Dataflow | Flink |

fixes the java wordcount direct runner test on windows by using the Gradle Github action.\r\nGradle Github action will use the `.bat` script on windows instead of the `gradlew` bash script.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that the previous test was running the test on windows using the `gradlew`\r\nbash script instead of the `gradlew.bat` which is what should be used on Windows.\r\nGithub actions has msys installed which would mean that the `gradlew` bash script would\r\nnot parse the arguments as expected.\r\nThe quotes would be removed from the `pipelineOptionsString` which would mean it was invalid JSON.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10886 for more details.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

original System.err\r\n\r\nCurrently such errors are logged to System.err which is a PrintStream that\r\npublishes to the handler.  This is perhaps unlikely to work if earlier publishing\r\nfailed and additionally removes a potential deadlock between the PrintStream\r\nobject sychronization and the Handler object synchronization. This was attempted\r\nto be fixed earlier by dissallowing the PrintStream object to be synchronized\r\nwhen calling into the handler.  However this is possible to be triggered by\r\nexternal synchronization on the PrintStream, such as that performed by\r\nThrowable.printStackTrace. Changing the PrintStream to use separate synchronization\r\nfor buffering works in most cases but not for cases where the stream is externally\r\nsynchronized.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://pkg.go.dev/mod/google.golang.org/protobuf there's a v2 variant of generated protocol buffer code for Go. As it stands, technically the v1 variants are now implemented in terms of v2, except that the base interface is now protoreflect.Message, rather than proto.MessageV. \r\nThey are implemented differently, which prevents the existing beam code from \"discovering\" protocol buffer types on pipeline analysis. This PR resolves it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, use the v2 marshaller/unmarshaller explicitly for user elements.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
