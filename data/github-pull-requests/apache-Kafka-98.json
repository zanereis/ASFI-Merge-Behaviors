introduced a bug leading to crashing the replica fetcher threads. The issue is that https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8672 deletes the Partitions prior to stopping the replica fetchers. As the replica fetchers relies access the Partition in the ReplicaManager, they crash with a NotLeaderOrFollowerException that is not handled.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the code to the original ordering to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\nThe regression has been caught by our system test: `kafkatest.tests.core.reassign_partitions_test`.\r\n\r\nI have not managed to reproduce the issue in a unit test without reimplementing the entire system test in Java.

kafka consumer already provides an operation to quickly lookup the offsets by timestamp by using the `offsetsForTimes` operation.\r\n\r\nHowever there are use cases where the inverse operation would be useful: having a set of offsets, I would like to lookup the ingestion timestamps for all these messages. Currently it would require fetching all these message by random access to retrieve the timestamps.\r\n\r\nThis add the `timesForOffsets` operation to the kafka consumer. The operation signature is equivalent to `offsetsForTimes`: given a mapping from partition to the offset to look up, it returns a mapping from partition to the timestamp and offset of the message at the requested offset. null is returned for the partition if there is no message at this offset.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7540\r\n\r\nIn short, the LEAVE_GROUP is sent to a shutdown broker so the dead member which is left in the group obstructs broker from completing rebalance.\r\n\r\nThe test case creates two consumers (with different group) and then shutdown their coordinator (broker). After first coordinator is shutdown, the heartbeat thread of first consumer gets timeout so it sends LEAVE_GROUP request to “next” coordinator. Unfortunately, the LEAVE_GROUP request can’t be processed successfully if the ”next” coordinator is the coordinator of second consumer (yep, it is shutdown also). \r\n\r\nThe simple approach is that we can reduce the session timeout so coordinator can evict dead member in time.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

on the discussion in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9072, I have put together an alternative way. This one does the following:\r\n* Instead of changing the implementation of the Rate to behave like a Token Bucket, it actually use two different metrics: the regular Rate and a new Token Bucket. The latter is used to enforce the quota.\r\n* The Token Bucket algorithm uses the rate of the quota as the refill rate for the credits and compute the burst based on the number of samples and their length (# samples * sample length * quota).\r\n* The Token Bucket algorithm used can go under zero in order to handle unlimited burst (e.g. create topic with a number of partitions higher than the burst). Throttling kicks in when the number of credits is under zero.\r\n* The throttle time is computed as credits under zero / refill rate (or quota).\r\n* Only the controller mutation uses it for now.\r\n* The remaining number of credits in the bucket is exposed with the `tokens` metrics per user/clientId.\r\n\r\nThe code can be improved and refactored.

returns an error when the topic's leader Id\r\nis present at MetadataCache but listener endpoint is not present for this leader.\r\nFor older version, LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned while

to return. This\r\ncould result in the call returning LISTENER_NOT_FOUND when it should\r\nhave returned LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE. This commit corrects this behavior.\r\n\r\nUnit tests were already present to test out the error codes returned\r\nunder different situations but they were giving out a false positive.\r\nThe test was using same broker id for both the MetadataCache's host as\r\nwell as for the topic's leader. Error manifests when the MetadataCache's\r\nhost id is changed. Improved the test.\r\n\r\nThis commit also consolidated couple of related tests to reduce code\r\nduplication.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

into its own test\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to remove usage of embedded broker (EmbeddedKafkaCluster) in AbstractJoinIntegrationTest and its subclasses.\r\nThis is because the tests under this class are no longer using the embedded broker, except for two.\r\ntestShouldAutoShutdownOnIncompleteMetadata is one of such tests.\r\nFurthermore, this test does not actually perfom stream-table join; it is testing an edge case of joining with a non-existent topic, so it should be in a separate test.\r\n\r\nTesting strategy: run existing unit and integration test\r\n\r\n@bbejeck \r\n\r\n### Committer

PR adds support for redirections of the following RPCs:\r\n  1. AlterConfigs\r\n  2. IncrementalAlterConfigs\r\n  3. AlterClientQuotas\r\n  4. CreateTopics\r\n\r\nThe specific changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Use the flag `RequestContext.fromPrivilegedListener` to indicate whether a request is **possibly** coming from the inter broker communication, details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9144). When a request is from a privileged listener, we would do a separate round of `CLUSTER_ACTION` authorization for a forwarding request.\r\n\r\n2. Add Envelope RPC for the request forwarding, and corresponding handling logic in KafkaApis\r\n\r\n3. Add forwarding support in the BrokerToControllerChannelManager\r\n \r\n4. Add a separate authorization of a forward request in the AuthorizableContext with a forwarding principal, and audit logging changes.\r\n\r\n5. Checks for the mentioned RPCs to do the redirection. Will do the forwarding when the request is not forwarded and the current broker is not the controller.\r\n\r\n6. Add broker IBP to guard against redirection. If IBP is low, any broker would still try to mutate ZK data with admin manager.\r\n\r\n7. Add support for principal serialization as an extendable interface called `KafkaPrincipalSerde`\r\n\r\n8. Built a template called `ForwardRequestHandler` to formulate the workflow of forward request handling \r\n\r\n9. Add SSL truststore/keystore path augment/trim logic to trigger file reload upon ZK notification\r\n\r\n10. Add IBP constraint tests for redirected RPCs since version 2.8, and KIP-500 flag to disable redirection.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Add supporting types to org.apache.kafka.common.config for the new network protocol instead of reusing the types in org.apache.kafka.common.quota.\r\n\r\n2. Have clients register supported configs to an internal topic so that compatibility information and static client configs can be returned to the administrator or processed with an external tool (e.g. Apache Druid). Set a log retention time on the topic and send the retention time back to each client that requests dynamic configs. Have clients register supported configs every time they pull their dynamic configs on an interval equal to the log retention time so that only compatibility information of active clients is kept in the internal topic.\r\n\r\n###

Background\r\n\r\nOn the broker side, ISR changes in the following cases:\r\n* Follow catches up to the leader, we expand the ISR\r\n* On a timer, we check for followers which have fallen out of sync, we shrink the ISR\r\n\r\nPreviously, we would synchronously update the partition state in ZK which includes the current leader+epoch as well as the ISR. The ZK version is used for concurrency control and is known to the broker (kept in LeaderAndIsr struct). In order to notify the controller of the ISR changes, the leader would periodically write to a special \"isr_change_notification\" znode which the controlled kept a ZK watch on. A list of modified partitions was written to this znode so the controller would only reload the necessary ISRs.\r\n\r\nWith [KIP-497](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-497%3A+Add+inter-broker+API+to+alter+ISR), we introduce an asynchronous ISR workflow that makes the controller the only component which can change the ISR state.\r\n\r\n# TLDR\r\n\r\n* ISR updates are now sent asynchronously to the controller\r\n* ISRs are now only persisted by the controller \r\n* Leader can immediately assume a larger ISR during ISR expansion\r\n* No more ZK watch mechanism for ISR propagation\r\n* Gated behind IBP 2.7-IV2\r\n\r\n# Broker changes\r\n\r\nNow when the broker wants to modify the ISR, it will send an AlterIsr request to the controller. Since this request can include any number of partition's ISR modifications, we will want to allow batching of ISR updates. This is done by adding a small delay (50ms) before sending the request to the controller after an ISR change is requested. By adding this delay, other ISR changes can accumulate before getting sent off as a single AlterIsr request. \r\n\r\nOnce the controller makes the update, it will return the updated ISR to the leader and send UpdateMetadata requests to the other interested brokers. As specified in the KIP, while a leader is waiting on the controller to respond it will assume the largest ISR (i.e., the union of the actual ISR and the pending ISR). For ISR expansions, this allows the leader to assume the new ISR right away. For ISR shrinks however, the leader must wait for confirmation from the controller that the ISR has been persisted (see the KIP for more details). We call this oversubscribed ISR the \"maximal\" ISR\r\n\r\nA new `AlterIsrManager` class is added which accumulates ISR changes and uses a background `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` thread to send AlterIsr requests to the controller.\r\n\r\nThe use of AlterIsr is only enabled when a broker is configured with IBP version 2.7-IV2 or greater.\r\n\r\n# Controller changes\r\n\r\nA new `AlterIsrReceived` controller event is added along with supporting methods for handling AlterIsr requests from KafkaApis as well as actually processing the request and modifying ZooKeeper. The proposed ISRs are validated against the controller's metadata before writing to ZK. Once all of the ISRs have been written out (or failed), the controller will return the AlterIsr response which includes the updated ISRs and zk versions.\r\n\r\nAfter returning the response, the controller will then send out UpdateMetadata requests for all partitions included in the AlterIsr request.\r\n\r\nIn order to support rolling upgrades and brokers on older IBP, the controller will accept AlterIsr and monitor the ZK watch for ISR changes. Once we fully migrate away from ZK, AlterIsr will be the only mechanism for updating the ISR.\r\n\r\n# Configs\r\n\r\nTODO \r\n\r\n#

PR #8962 we introduced a sentinel UNKNOWN_OFFSET to mark unknown offsets in checkpoint files. The sentinel was set to -2 which is the same value used for the sentinel LATEST_OFFSET that is used in subscriptions to signal that state stores have been used by an active task. Unfortunately, we missed to skip UNKNOWN_OFFSET when we compute the sum of the changelog offsets.\r\n\r\nIf a task had only one state store and it did not restore anything before the next rebalance, the stream thread wrote -2 (i.e., UNKNOWN_OFFSET) into the subscription as sum of the changelog offsets. During assignment, the leader interpreted the -2 as if the stream run the task as active although it might have run it as standby. This misinterpretation of the sentinel value resulted in unexpected task assigments.\r\n\r\nThis is a port of PR #9066 to trunk.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

I tried to read the codes to understand what the `constrainedAssign` and `generalAssign` method is doing, but it is so difficult and suffering due to the complexity of the algorithm. And then I traced back to the JIRA ticket and KIP to get much more information about them. So, I think we should put at least the algorithm goal and main steps in the code comments, to let other developers better understand them and better do trouble shooting if any. \r\n\r\n**reference for

AK protocol often relies on sentinel value (e.g. null or -1) to indicate that a field was not provided. Usually, these sentinels are turned into `java.util.Optional` that is empty when the field is equal to the sentinel. Until now, we were doing this transformation while mapping the Struct to internal Request or Response classes. With the generated protocol, we would like to get rid of these internal classes and also avoid spending time to construct them.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to support `java.util.Optional` in the auto-generated classes. A field can be marked as `optional` that indicates to the generator that its type must be wrapped in an `Optional`.\r\n\r\nWhen an optional is written, its internal value is used or its default if the optional is undefined. When an option is read, the value read is used or it defaults to an empty optional if the default value is read.\r\n\r\nI did a deep integration by changing all the places where values are written or read to do the above conversions. I just wrote it as a proof of concept to discuss this further. The code may be simplified.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this would be to only provide getters and setters which convert the internal value to an Optional and vice versa. That would limit the scope of the change. The downside would be that every time the getters or the setters are called, it requires to do the conversion.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

PR #8962 we introduced a sentinel UNKNOWN_OFFSET to mark unknown offsets in checkpoint files. The sentinel was set to -2 which is the same value used for the sentinel LATEST_OFFSET that is used in subscriptions to signal that state stores have been used by an active task. Unfortunately, we missed to skip UNKNOWN_OFFSET when we compute the sum of the changelog offsets. \r\n\r\nIf a task had only one state store and it did not restore anything before the next rebalance, the stream thread wrote -2 (i.e., UNKNOWN_OFFSET) into the subscription as sum of the changelog offsets. During assignment, the leader interpreted the -2 as if the stream run the task as active although it might have run it as standby. This misinterpretation of the sentinel value resulted in unexpected task assigments.  \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

would previously update the map by adding the new replicas to the map and then removing the old ones. During a recent refactoring, we changed the logic to first clear the map and then add all the replicas to it.\r\n\r\nWhile this is done in a write lock, not all callers that access the map structure use a lock. It is safer to revert to the previous behavior of showing the intermediate state of the map with extra replicas, rather than an intermediate state of the map with no

the test, we first test removing 1 member from group, and then test removing the other 2 members from group, and it failed sometimes at the 2nd member number assert. After investigation, I found it's because we enabled auto commit for the consumers(default setting), and the removed consumer offset commit will get the `UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID` error, which will then make the member rejoin. (check ConsumerCoordinator#OffsetCommitResponseHandler) So, that's why after the 2nd members removing, the members will sometimes be not empty. \r\n\r\nI set the consumer config to disable the auto commit to fix this issue.

we remove the Log metrics when asynchronous deletion of the log is triggered. However, we attempt to register the metrics immediately upon log creation. If a Log object is re-created for a partition that is pending deletion (because a topic was quickly re-created or because a partition was moved off and back onto a broker), the registration of the new metrics can happen before the asyncrhonous deletion. In this case, the metrics are removed after the second registration, leading to missing Log metrics.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this patch changes the log deletion behavior to remove the metrics when the log is first marked for deletion, rather than when the files are deleted. This removes the window in which metrics registration can occur before metrics removal. This is justifiable because the log should be logically deleted when a delete request or partition movement finishes, rather than when the files are actually removed. Tested with unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T16:47:19Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T02:40:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-31T02:12:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94270ae825f15ddeb67687f1965160e1fa3b49f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/150aec1cf67f2e3318c9d7ca748fef6057f8e6a1","head":{"label":"bob-barrett:KAFKA-10282","ref":"KAFKA-10282","sha":"150aec1cf67f2e3318c9d7ca748fef6057f8e6a1","user":{"login":"bob-barrett","id":12191224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkxMjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12191224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett","html_url":"https://github.com/bob-barrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":151277854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTEyNzc4NTQ=","name":"kafka","full_name":"bob-barrett/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bob-barrett","id":12191224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkxMjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12191224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett","html_url":"https://github.com/bob-barrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-barrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bob-barrett/kafka","description":"Mirror
