has been introduced and has the common code used for both a non-tx put (RegionMapPut) and a tx put (RegionMapCommitPut).\r\nRegionMapCommitPut is used by txApplyPut. I thought this name was better than RegionMapTransactionPut because this is not a put done during a transaction but what needs to be done at commit time for a put that was done during a transaction. Another possible name would be RegionMapTransactionApplyPut but I liked CommitPut better because it is more concise.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests provide good coverage for both AbstractRegionMapPut and RegionMapCommitPut.\r\nThe old unit test for RegionMapPut still exists and has been improved but still does not cover all the code in RegionMapPut class. I will file a ticket to improve that test.

goal of this refactor was to combine three large blocks of code into one method. These three blocks were 90% duplicates of each other.\r\nThe new method in the resulting code is: txApplyPutRegionEntry.\r\nI new class was introduced, TxApplyPutContext, which is expected to go away in a future refactoring when txApplyPut is changed to use a subclass of RegionMapPut.\r\nThe control flow in txApplyPut has also been changed to follow the pattern of RegionMapPut which will aid that future refactoring.\r\n\r\n@dhemery
