diff implements C++ topi contributions for:\r\n  - relu with parametrix threshold\r\n  - pad with generic padBefore / padAfter specification\r\n  - matmult with transposes\r\n  - conv2d_nchw, conv2d_hwcn with runtime constant padding and strides\r\n  - depthwise_conv2d_nchw with runtime constant padding and strides\r\n  - group_conv2d_ngchw with runtime constant padding and strides\r\n  - broadcast_to a broadcastable shape\r\n  - broadcast_bop where bop is an usual binary op (+ - * / %)\r\n\r\nConvolution padding is implemented using the pad operation.\r\nTo avoid extra memory consumption, it is generally recommended to inline the padding with the autoinliner.\r\nUnfortunately in its current form the elemwise checks are too restrictive to allow inlining.\r\nSo this diff also proposes an extension to LHS injective (i.e. no reduction axis in the current IR design)\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nTested in C++ testsuite in a separate repository, I am looking for suggestions to quickly spin up some tests for tvm.\r\n\r\nReviewers: tqchen\r\n\r\nSubscribers:\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\nTags:\r\n\r\nBlame
