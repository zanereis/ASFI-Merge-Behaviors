TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10044\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThis feature allows to change permission for existing role permissions, as those were static and could not be changed once created. It also provides the ability to change these permissions in the UI using a drop down menu for each permission rule, in which admin can select ‘Allow’ or ‘Deny’ permission.\r\n\r\n### Changes in the API:\r\nThis feature modifies behaviour of `updateRolePermission` API method: \r\n- New optional parameters ‘ruleid’ and ‘permission’ are introduced, they are mutual exclusive to ‘ruleorder’ parameter. This defines two use cases:\r\n   - Update role permission: ‘ruleid’ and ‘permission’ parameters needed\r\n   - Update rules order: ‘ruleorder’ parameter needed\r\n- Parameter ‘ruleorder’ is now optional\r\n- updateRolePermission providing ‘ruleorder’ parameter should be sent via POST\r\n\r\n### Changes in the UI:\r\nDrop down menu added for role rule-permissions as seen in attached picture\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12881210/UpdateRolePermissionUI.jpg

The idea is the larger volume you create, the greater your IOPS will be (this is similar to the way GCE handles IOPS). We also have added limits to the IOPS (min and max) so that once the volume goes beyond a certain size, the IOPS won't change and are capped to the given values.\r\n\r\nThe following parameters are added to the `createDiskOffering` API:\r\n\r\n1. `miniopspergb' : Minimum IOPS/GB for the offering\r\n2. `maxiopspergb`: Maximum IOPS/GB for the offering\r\n3. `highestminiops`: The highest `miniops` value that is allowed for this offering\r\n3. `highestmaxiops`: The highest `maxiops` value that is allowed for this

issue occurs only with KVM hypervisor**. Database entries for templates created from snapshots disappear after management-server service restart\r\n\r\n**STEPS TO REPRODUCE**\r\n\r\n1. Create a ACS setup and add KVM hypervisor as host.\r\n2. Create snapshot of any disk (root or data disk) of an instance.\r\n3. Create template using disk snapshot.\r\n4. Verify that template got downloaded completely and is in Ready state.\r\n5. Also, verify that entry for this template is present in template_store_ref table in database.\r\n6. Now restart management server.\r\n7. Once management server is restarted completely and web UI is available, check the template status. It will be in Active state instead of downloaded.\r\n8. Also, entry for this template vanishes from template_store_ref table in database.\r\n\r\n**Fix for the Issue**\r\n\r\nIn NfsSecondaryStorageResource.java class, inside method copySnapshotToTemplateFromNfsToNfs() bufferwriter which was created for writing data in template.properties file is not closed and hence few properties were not getting written in template.properties. As few properties were absent in template.properties file, so after management server restart, this template is not loaded and hence it goes into Active state.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot of Template.properties before fix :** \r\n\r\n![screenshot before fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25146827/28970559-98af42d6-7946-11e7-9855-780d0d2cc002.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Screenshot of

STEPS:\r\nCreate a Windows VM with Multiple NICs\r\nEnsure that only one of the NICs can actually access internet (set that as default NIC in ACS)\r\nTry to access internet\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\r\nWindows VM should be able to access internet\r\n\r\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR:\r\nWindows VM is not able to access internet\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows will experience issue if we have multiple default gateway assigned as explained in \"Multiple Default Gateways Can Cause Connectivity Problems\" (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/159168).  \r\n\r\nYou may want to make Windows to select certain gateway always, we can change interface metrics:\r\n \r\nGo to your Network adapter properties\r\nSelect Internet Protocol v4.\r\nClick the Advanced button on General tab.\r\nUncheck Automatic metric.\r\nEnter a number higher than 10 to the Interface metric field.\r\n\r\nThe default automatic metric for interfaces is 10. The lower the metric, the higher the preference to use it. So, we have to enter metric higher than 10 for the interfaces you don't want to use. This is because if Windows has multiple interfaces connected to several networks that use DHCP, it installs default gateways for all those interfaces. By default, Windows sets the metric of the default gateways to the same, effectively leading to random selection of default gateway.\r\n\r\nWindow stand point the above mentioned issue can be resolved by setting metric for NICs inside guest OS\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-31T12:08:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T16:03:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T16:03:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3575734438c7453af71d43a34abf1105581d4f27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/6197acebe885b494e7b94fde9082b54636e86ea2","head":{"label":"jayakarteek:CLOUDSTACK-10023","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-10023","sha":"6197acebe885b494e7b94fde9082b54636e86ea2","user":{"login":"jayakarteek","id":23551298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUxMjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23551298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek","html_url":"https://github.com/jayakarteek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74328706,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDMyODcwNg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"jayakarteek/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jayakarteek","id":23551298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUxMjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23551298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek","html_url":"https://github.com/jayakarteek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayakarteek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jayakarteek/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

Most of them are related to the fact that some functions don't take the projectid or the vpcid parameter. This PR is an attempt to fix those problems and have better testability of setups with VPC and

cannot make plain tcp request, hence the websocket request have to be forwarded to the VNC server via a proxy server that basically converts websocket request recieved from client to plain tcp request for VNC server.\r\n\r\nWe have shifted the all context handler of ajax based VNC system to a jetty server, and add a websocket handler to handle noVNC client

am not sure if a regression was introduced with this PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2062, but we have found issues with this configuration now that we have it in production.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that all the testing we had scripted to test this feature did not have adequate sleep time.  There are situations with the current configuration where the connection is established for 5-10 seconds, but drops afterwards.  The testing I was doing was checking if the connection was established in that window, so the test would always return as success even though the connection would drop after the test.  \r\n\r\n@syed and I have done about 20 hours of testing and troubleshooting to get to the root cause of the problem.  Previously, by having both sides of the VPN connection `auto=start`, the VPN connection would have problems initializing.\r\n\r\nThe core of this change is to change the S2S VPN config from `auto=start` to `auto=route`.  Read more about this setting here: https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/ConnSection\r\nWe found there to be issues when using `auto=start` for both sides of the connection as there was problem negotiating the connection.  Instead the `auto=route` config will only establish a connection once there is an attempt to send traffic over the connection.  In order to attempt to open the connection as soon as the VPN connection is configured, a ping to the other side of the connection has been added to establish the connection.\r\n\r\nI was able to consistently reproduce failure scenarios with the previous configuration by doing the following:\r\n- Enable VPN Gateways on two different VPCs\r\n- Create both VPN Customer Gateways on the two VPCs\r\n- After 10 seconds, create the first VPN Connection\r\n- After 5 seconds, create the second VPN Connection\r\n- Wait 35 seconds to let the `checks2svpn.sh` check to run\r\n- List the VPN Connections to validate the connection State is correct\r\n- SSH into a VM in one VPC and ping a VM on the other VPC.\r\n- Tear down the VPN Connections and Gateways\r\n- Wait 150 seconds between tests to ensure the the ipsec VPN running state is cleared (I believe this is related to the `dpdtimeout=120`, but I did not spend the time to try to isolate that for sure).\r\n\r\nHere are the results after applying this fix and testing with the above process:

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10006\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nOne of the most useful features provided by Vmware is DRS (Distributed Resources Scheduler), whose main job is to load balance workload within clusters when needed (given a migration threshold). However, this feature is only available for Enterprise Plus licenses. We would like a way to provide a similar feature internal to CloudStack for those Vmware licenses which don't have DRS feature available.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThis feature is disabled by default, it can be activated by switching global setting: `vmware.drs.internal.enabled` to `true` (management server restart is required).\r\nWhen feature is active, it would set a a thread per cluster which will execute every `vmware.drs.interval` seconds:\r\n\r\n- If cluster setting: `vmware.drs.internal.enabled = false` -> no action performed on cluster\r\n- If cluster setting: `vmware.drs.internal.enabled = true`:\r\n   - Get cluster hosts statistics and calculate cluster imbalance\r\n   - While cluster imbalance > `vmware.drs.threshold`:\r\n      - If no good migration is found -> stop\r\n      - If good migration is found -> it is added to the list of recommendations\r\n\r\nGood migration search works like this:\r\n- For each VM v:\r\n   - For each host h that is not Source Host:\r\n      - Simulate move v to h\r\n      - Measure new cluster-wide load imbalance metric as g\r\n- Return move v that gives least cluster-wide imbalance g.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-17T17:23:06Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:53:22Z","closed_at":"2018-12-27T03:25:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"395e8ff8c9c17dcc2fa741ae648d11f369c373da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/e770b991a933328457db099d92831a8da056c6a9","head":{"label":"nvazquez:drs-implementation","ref":"drs-implementation","sha":"e770b991a933328457db099d92831a8da056c6a9","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

are not deleted resulting unexpected storage consumption in case of VMware.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce this issue :** \r\n\r\n1. In VMware setup, create a snapshot of volume say Snap1.\r\n2. After successful creation of snapshot Snap1, create new snapshot of same volume say Snap2.snapshots\r\n3. While Snap2 is in BackingUp state, delete Snap1.\r\n4. Snap1 will disappear from Web UI, but when we check secondary storage, files associated with Snap1 still persists even after cleanup job is performed.\r\n5. In snapshot_store_ref table in DB, Snap1 will be in ready state instead of Destroyed.\r\n6. Also, in snapshots table, status of Snap1 will be Destroyed but removed column will be null and will never change to the date of snapshot removal.\r\n\r\n**Fix for this issue :** \r\n\r\n1. In VMware, snapshot chain is not maintained, instead full snapshot is taken every time.\r\n2. So, it makes sense not to assign parent snapshot id for the snapshot. In this way, every snapshot will be individual and can be deleted successfully whenever required.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot of DB before applying fix :**\r\n![db screenshot before

Create an environment having zone with 2 Clusters and atleast 1 host associated with each cluster.\r\n2. Verify that all clusters are in managed state and all hosts are in up state.\r\n3. Change the value of global setting \"direct.agent.load.size\" to 1.\r\n4. Restart management server.\r\n5. Check \"id\" of both clusters.\r\n6. Change state of both the clusters to Unmanaged state.\r\n7. Try to change the cluster which has higher \"id\" to managed state. Cluster will come to manage state.\r\n8.

an environment is upgraded to 4.10, then while registering template for a zone from cloudstack UI will fail if it is created in older version(before 3.x). \r\n\r\nThis bug got introduced with the PR#1894 for CLOUDSTACK-9700. In this PR a new parameter ‘zoneIds’ was added to the registerTemplate api and is marked with the ‘since’ attribute as ‘4.10.0.0’. since attribute is suppose to provide version for the containing data, not about when parameter was introduced. Although the parameter was introduced in 4.10, but it can contain the information from earlier version, thus it is wrongly marked here as ‘4.10.0.0’.  \r\n\r\nThis issue occurs because zones from older version have UUID parameter value as Integer, whereas higher version zones have fixed format. So while fetching the ZoneIds for installing templates, parsing for UUID with integer value fails and hence template is not installed.\r\n\r\nFix :\r\n\r\nFor the sake of backward compatibility, along with UUID, integer is also being parsed while retrieving ZoneId for the installing templates. Integer value of UUID cannot be converted into the fixed format because this value is used as a hard coded value in few automation scripts which runs locally for some customers. Hence, \"since\" attribute should be removed from a parameter command for ZoneIds. \r\n\r\n**Screenshot before applying fix :**\r\n![screenshot before
