What is this PR for?\r\nThis pull request introduces a mechanism to initialize Notes in the background.\r\nA consumer is passed, which is then called with the NoteId.\r\nThe consumer itself is responsible for checking, for example, whether the note still exists.\r\nThe initialization runs in several threads. The consumer must therefore be thread-safe.\r\nThis approach scales well, in my opinion, because it makes effective use of NoteCache. Another approach, e.g. to initialize the Notes in the sub-module, would not utilize the NoteCache as effectively. This is true if one sub-module is faster than the other.\r\n\r\nChanges to the CronJob behavior:\r\nAs soon as a CronJob is executed, we have checked in the execution whether it is allowed to execute the Notes at all. If not, we have skipped it. With the changes in this PR we check before execution if the CronJob is allowed to run. This is controlled by the interface `TriggerListener`, which has the possibility to give the CronJob a veto for execution.\r\nWith this change the not meaningful skip metric is avoided.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n - Improvement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5754\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-21T15:34:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T08:03:45Z","closed_at":"2022-07-06T07:35:55Z","merged_at":"2022-07-06T07:35:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ddbd908687b826722673139f37fd2dde2c95ce5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/888d98dcb722cc7db6ec42851cbf01d820cf6e65","head":{"label":"Reamer:search_start","ref":"search_start","sha":"888d98dcb722cc7db6ec42851cbf01d820cf6e65","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203154995,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxNTQ5OTU=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Reamer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

No\r\n\r\nI also noticed there is another call of flexmark in `org.apache.zeppelin.jupyter.parser.MarkdownParser`. But it seems the package `jupyter` can not read from configuration.

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen multi users perform some notebook/folder operation, like rename or move, some notebooks become not accessible from zeppelin page, while they are still existing on the HDFS, and only resort to restart Zeppelin daemon to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, unit test is created to simulate the concurrent request scenario and reproduce the issue successfully, including the operations of saveNote, moveNote, moveFolder and removeNote.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, some changes are made to ensure thread safety of note manager operation, so that the note or folder info will not be lost, after which the unit test should get passed.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5744\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Automated unit tests for the change is added.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-28T02:20:33Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T12:56:18Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T12:56:18Z","merged_at":"2022-06-03T12:56:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"525d3617b08573dc0272cc94735721a09b21716a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/9f37811153242b55b1a62cac9bb21e019aef77e3","head":{"label":"saLeox:master","ref":"master","sha":"9f37811153242b55b1a62cac9bb21e019aef77e3","user":{"login":"saLeox","id":23732067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzMyMDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23732067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox","html_url":"https://github.com/saLeox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452924887,"node_id":"R_kgDOGv8V1w","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"saLeox/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"saLeox","id":23732067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzMyMDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23732067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox","html_url":"https://github.com/saLeox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saLeox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/saLeox/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis pull request extends the existing PluginManager. The Java Plugin Framework PF4J is used for this purpose. My goal of this change is a better separation of Java libraries to avoid overlapping dependencies.\r\nThe following change after this PullRequest makes sense to me:\r\n - Definition of plugin configurations in the plugin itself and not in the big ZeppelinConfiguration class\r\n - Further outsourcing of components from the zengine, e.g. hadoop, lucene, cron\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n - Improvement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Documentation\r\n* [x] - License file\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5722\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* via CI and manual \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

@corneadoug, @Reamer , I'd like to report a vulnerability dependency in **org.apache.zeppelin:zeppelin-cassandra:0.10.1**.\r\n### Issue Description\r\nI noticed that **org.apache.zeppelin:zeppelin-cassandra:0.10.1** directly depends on **org.lz4:lz4-java:1.6.0** in the [pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/zeppelin/zeppelin-cassandra/0.10.1/zeppelin-cassandra-0.10.1.pom). However, as shown in the following dependency graph, **org.lz4:lz4-java:1.6.0** sufferes from the vulnerabilites which the C library **lz4(version:1.9.1)** exposed, containing a high severity CVE: [CVE-2019-17543](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17543).\r\n### Dependency Graph between Java and Shared Libraries\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103260963/163198977-5211f6a1-075b-4e14-96ab-03eddec062a8.png)\r\n### Suggested Vulnerability Patch Versions\r\n**org.lz4:lz4-java:1.7.0** (**>=1.7.0**) has upgraded the vulnerable C library `lz4` to the patch version **1.9.2**. \r\n\r\nJava build tools cannot report vulnerable C libraries, which may induce potential security issues to many downstream Java projects.

What is this PR for?\r\nFor user under runner role, the editor is hidden, so the **$scope.editor object** is not empty and the **$scope.editor.getValue()** function may return a null value.\r\n\r\nSo there should be one more condition to judge: if user cannot view editor, it's also expected to get editor value from **$scope.paragraph.text** as well.\r\n\r\nThe **$scope.viewOnly** in notebook.controller.js determines whether the editor is editable for user, and when user is under role of owner or writer, the value will become true.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there's one `spark-scala-parent` module which is shared by multiple scala module. This can reduce code duplication, but bring difficulties for developing spark module. It is not easy for new developers to configure it properly in IDE and run unit test in IDE. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to restructure the spark module: move the code in spark-scala-parent to each scala module (scala-2.11,scala-2.12,scala-2.13), this would cause code duplication, but ease the development phase and maintenance. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, you can run spark unit test directly without any extra configuration in intellij. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5702\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?
