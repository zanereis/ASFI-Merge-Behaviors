Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This speeds up the installation of the CodeQL tools. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2573\">#2573</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2576\">#2576</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.27.0 - 22 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2549\">#2549</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action would fail with &quot;upload-sarif post-action step failed: Input required and not supplied: token&quot; when called in a composite Action that had a different set of inputs to the ones expected by the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2557\">#2557</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2552\">#2552</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.13 - 14 Oct 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519\">#2519</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2573\">#2573</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2576\">#2576</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.27.0 - 22 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2549\">#2549</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action would fail with &quot;upload-sarif post-action step failed: Input required and not supplied: token&quot; when called in a composite Action that had a different set of inputs to the ones expected by the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2557\">#2557</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2552\">#2552</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.13 - 14 Oct 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519\">#2519</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.13 - 14 Oct 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519\">#2519</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.
