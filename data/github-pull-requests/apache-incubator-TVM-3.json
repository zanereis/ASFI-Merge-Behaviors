is a bug when we use WSL2 or other virtual machine in NAT mode as host, the host can find the device easily, but when device respond to the host, it will lose the device ip address, in this case, host will just try to find a IP that is used for visiting from virtual machine(e,g, WSL2, 172.xxx.xxx.xxx) to physical host, this IP cannot be used to visit device, this will make the server in device  print\"no incoming connections \", because the host cannot find the device\r\n\r\nTo fix the bug, I just pass the real IP of device to host,which can solve this problem. But this fix need Internet to get device IP, I wonder if there is a better way.

PR fixes ORCJIT link failures for RISC-V targets by properly setting the code model on the executor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInitial bug report is here: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/run-tvm-software-stack-on-risc-v/17683\r\n\r\n#### Rationale\r\n\r\n* RISC-V recommended and required code model was set already here, but was ignored: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e468426bfd43fadb555ef0e561b9047a5d89852e/src/target/llvm/llvm_instance.cc#L276-L280\r\n* RISC-V targets will work only with the newer ORCJIT engine as described in [PR#15964]( https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15964)\r\n* This PR adds missing code model settings for the ORCJIT engine.\r\n\r\nIn case of RISC-V, by not setting the code model to explicit ```Medium``` may give ralocation ```R_RISCV_HI20``` errors.\r\n\r\nCc: @Lunderberg , @ekalda , @lhutton1 , @quic-sanirudh ,  @tqchen\r\nCc: @katebern-grovety , @PhilippvK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### LATER UPDATE (due to unexpected i386 failure):\r\n\r\n  * This PR propagates explicit code/reloc model *only* for RISC-V arches.\r\n  * Just as before, by default will leave the ORCJIT to decide the best code/reloc\r\n  * Same JIT setup, and RISCV case handling can be seen in the [Halide ORCJIT](https://github.com/halide/Halide/blob/eb66c06539d623459ea3c3abeea5b7cce111ad5f/src/JITModule.cpp#L342-L344)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-08T12:17:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T07:52:35Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T07:52:35Z","merged_at":"2024-09-10T07:52:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7e0af2d88f75e2ab21c6dbde43813a033c0fb35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f30297a18398ccc73c91e794de62594ea1bdecd2","head":{"label":"cbalint13:llvm-orcjit-codemodel","ref":"llvm-orcjit-codemodel","sha":"f30297a18398ccc73c91e794de62594ea1bdecd2","user":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":702617803,"node_id":"R_kgDOKeEYyw","name":"tvm","full_name":"cbalint13/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13/tvm","description":"Open

the qnn.avg_pool2d operator does not take the layout specified with the Convert Layout pass.\r\n \r\n**Cause:**\r\nThe layout of the zero point and scale tensors are specified as \"undefined\". This causes the Convert Layout pass to bail and maintain the original layout.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nThe fix updates the layouts for the scale and zero point tensors to be \"channel\" layout, similar to

to this commit, all Hexagon test cases in `tests/cpp-runtime/hexagon` were executed as part of a single unit test in pytest.  This can take a significant portion of the total timeout in CI (~50 minutes out of a 2-hour timeout).  While the hexagon tests are split out onto 8 separate runners, having a single large test can cause timeouts on whichever runner happens to receive it.\r\n\r\nThis commit exposes each unit test from `tests/cpp-runtime/hexagon` into a separate unit test in pytest, to avoid these timeouts.","created_at":"2024-09-04T17:35:33Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T16:45:06Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T16:45:04Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T16:45:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"26fec76b93806587c5c9bf614b5d3aa218b6e53f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/df35f093550af969917671028548414b6bde394a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ci_hexagon_break_up_call_to_gtest","ref":"ci_hexagon_break_up_call_to_gtest","sha":"df35f093550af969917671028548414b6bde394a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the Relax well-formed checker verified that each expression had a non-null `StructInfo` annotation, but did not perform any validation on the contents of the `StructInfo` annotation.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the Relax well-formed check to verify that the `StructInfo` annotations are accurate by comparing against the `StructInfo` that would be inferred for an expression.  (This only requires that the information is accurate, not that it is complete. For example, an expression that is inferred to be `R.Tensor(shape=[128,8], dtype=\"float32\")` may have annotation of `R.Tensor(ndim=2, dtype=\"float32\"`, but may not have an annotation of `R.Tensor(shape=[128,8],

`Function.bind_params` method requires all bound values to have `StructInfo` annotations.  While these are generated on construction for `relax::Constant` and `relax::PrimValue`, the most common cases of bound values, other useful expression such as `relax.op.zeros(shape,dtype)` do not have `StructInfo` until they are normalized.  In addition, because `Function.bind_params` may be used in contexts that do not have a `relax.BlockBuilder` available, performing this normalization is not straightforward.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the constructors for Relax operations within the `tvm.relax.op.create` namespace to infer their `StructInfo` on construction, if it is possible to do so.  This allows these operations to be used inside `Function.bind_params`.","created_at":"2024-08-30T18:10:17Z","updated_at":"2024-09-16T19:44:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/72ee4f6a19a21711d49eac9154f18f078d13fa1f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_allow_op_create_expressions_in_function_bind_params","ref":"relax_allow_op_create_expressions_in_function_bind_params","sha":"72ee4f6a19a21711d49eac9154f18f078d13fa1f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`LiftTransformParams` pass produces additional functions, either named `$FOO_transform_params` when generating one transformation function per inference function, or `transform_params` when generating a single shared transformation function.  Prior to this commit, if the `IRModule` already contained a function with that name, an error would be raised.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, the `LiftTransformParams` pass will instead check for existing functions, and compose the previous transformation function with the newly-lifted transformation.  This allows `LiftTransformParams` to be used alongside a hand-written parameter transformation.\r\n\r\nCloses

to this commit, the `CanonicalizeBindings` pass could identify and simplify a value that had been packed into a tuple, then extracted from it.  (e.g. Simplifying `tup = (x,y); z = tup[0]` into `z = x`.)  However, it could not identify a value that had been expanded from a tuple, and then re-bundled.  (e.g. Simplifying `new_tuple = (tup[0], tup[1])` into `new_tuple = tup`.)\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `CanonicalizeBindings` to identify and remove unnecessary tuple

a Relax function contains an `R.match_cast` that defines a symbolic shape, and the value provided to the `R.match_cast` has a known static shape, the `relax.transform.CanoncalizeBindings()` pass can in-line the known static shape.  However, while these known TIR values were only collected if the expression used in `R.match_cast` was a `R.Tensor`, `R.Shape`, and `R.Prim` (Relax types which may contain symbolic TIR values), they were not collected if the `R.match_cast` expression was a `R.Tuple`.\r\n\r\nFor example, while using `R.match_cast` to convert from `R.Tensor([16])` to `R.Tensor([batch_size])` would identify that `batch_size` must be `16`, using `R.match_cast` to convert from `R.Tuple(R.Tensor([16]))` to `R.Tuple(R.Tensor([batch_size]))` would not.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `InferSymbolicVarMap` to collect all symbolic shapes, even if they occur within a `R.Tuple`.","created_at":"2024-08-28T16:04:57Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T14:01:55Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T22:43:54Z","merged_at":"2024-08-28T22:43:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"be8607d47fa418f6bf77671b81093e0ffd7fdc4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/cc90ca6955b3c88ba036e97842b3ad812614afc2","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_bugfix_infer_tir_values_from_shape_inside_tuple","ref":"relax_bugfix_infer_tir_values_from_shape_inside_tuple","sha":"cc90ca6955b3c88ba036e97842b3ad812614afc2","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

general, intermediate values produced while evaluating Relax functions are not visible to an end user.  While this provides stronger guarantees to the compiler, it can make debugging difficult. For example, if an end-to-end model is producing incorrect results, it can be difficult to determine which step of the model first introduced an error.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements `relax.transform.InjectDebugCallback`, which adds a `debug_callback` parameter to each externally-exposed function of an `IRModule`.  This callback is called with the name and value of each variable binding within the function bodies, allowing error-checking to be added.  For example, a binding of `B = R.add(A,A)` would be followed by `debug_callback(\"B\", B)`.","created_at":"2024-08-19T13:20:37Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T13:20:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b466dc44c4846ce2b2374f5234a8aa048d0d6ca6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/575cdc5504fecf83712090a0e7299f6b3dc879c3","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:utility_relax_inject_debug_callback","ref":"utility_relax_inject_debug_callback","sha":"575cdc5504fecf83712090a0e7299f6b3dc879c3","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16183, these changes were reverted in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/17252 due to performance degredation in some Relax models.

to this commit, the `relax.transform.RemoveUnusedOutputs` pass only marked a tuple element as used if it occurred in a `TupleGetItem` node.  This ignored use cases where a tuple is used as an aggregate object, such as returning a tuple from a function.  This would collect incorrect results for a Relax function that calls a subroutine, receives a tuple as the return value of the subroutine, then returns that tuple.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `RemoveUnusedOutputs` to look for usage of a tuple object, not just for usage in `TupleGetItem`.\r\n\r\nCloses

However, we cannot set `deviceLostIsError` immediately to true after calling `this.lib.dispose()` (which calls `device.destroy()`) because WebGPU is asynchronous.

to this commit, `NaN` values did not have any special handling in either `StructuralEqual` or `StructuralHash`.\r\n\r\n`StructuralEqual` checked whether the LHS and RHS were within some tolerance of each other.  If the LHS and RHS are both `NaN`, this would evaluate to false.  The updated `StructuralEqual` now checks for this case, and returns true if both sides are `NaN`.\r\n\r\n`StructuralHash` used the bit-pattern of a floating-point number to compute the hash.  A `NaN` value may have any non-zero value in its mantissa, and so this could produce distinct hashes for ASTs that differ only by the choice of non-zero value.  The updated `StructuralHash` uses the same `std::numeric_limits<double::quiet_NaN()` value for all `NaN` values.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, `StructuralEqual` and `StructuralHash` can now compare two IR functions, even if they contain `NaN`.\r\n\r\nCloses

to this commit, various header files had `using namespace tvm::runtime`, which imports all names from `tvm::runtime` into the current namespace.\r\n\r\nThese imports can cause compilation errors depending on the order of `#include` statements.  For example, the `#include <tvm/relay/attrs/transform.h>` file uses the unqualified name `Bool` to refer to `::tvm::Bool`, a subclass of `PrimExpr`.  If a different header file specifies `using namespace tvm::runtime` within the `tvm::relay` namespace, then the unqualified name `Bool` ambiguously refers to either `::tvm::Bool` or `::tvm::runtime::Bool`.\r\n\r\nIn MSVC, this can cause even further compilation errors.  By default, MSVC does not follow the C++ standard for name resolution in templates.  The standard requires that any names in a template that do not depend on template parameters be resolved when the template is declared.  However, MSVC instead resolves these names when the template is instantiated.  As a result, the same `using namespace tvm::runtime` may cause a compilation error if it occurs after the template's declaration, but before the template's usage.\r\n\r\n(TVM provides the `/permissive-` flag to MSVC builds specifically to disable MSVC's non-standard name resolution, so this only impacts downstream forks that disable this flag.  See https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16343 for more details.)\r\n\r\nThis commit removes `using namespace tvm::runtime`, replacing them with explicit `using tvm::runtime::SOME_SPECIFIC_SYMBOL` where necessary.  This resolves both the include-order dependency for standards-compliant compilers, and the compilation errors for MSVC's default build.","created_at":"2024-08-06T15:57:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T17:14:42Z","closed_at":"2024-08-22T17:12:57Z","merged_at":"2024-08-22T17:12:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"20289e8502dd27c91f3945418c864ad7233aec89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4a01e7852ea3208be60badfad64c8887d32847f0","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:cleanup_remove_using_namespace_tvm_runtime","ref":"cleanup_remove_using_namespace_tvm_runtime","sha":"4a01e7852ea3208be60badfad64c8887d32847f0","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the different `R.call_tir*` variations would wrap the arguments into an in-line `relax.Tuple`, if it is not already a `relax.Tuple`.  While this allows a tensor to be passed into these functions as a single argument (`R.call_tir(func, arg, ...)` instead of `R.call_tir(func, [arg], ...)`), the wrapped Relax variable may already refer to a tuple.\r\n\r\nThis use of a variable to refer to an argument tuple rather than an in-line argument tuple is not allowed by Relax.  (See discussion on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15916 for details.)  However, by wrapping a variable `args: R.Tuple(R.Tensor, R.Tensor, ...)` into a tuple-of-tuples, the error occurs after the expression has already been generated, and refers to an expression `R.Tuple(R.Tuple(R.Tensor, R.Tensor, ...))` that doesn't appear anywhere in the user's input. This can make debugging difficult (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17239 for an example).\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the argument-handling in `R.call_tir` to only generate an in-line `relax.Tuple` if the arguments do not already have `relax.TupleStructInfo`.  If the argument was provided as a Relax variable bound to a tuple of arguments, it will still produce an error.  However, that error will occur much earlier, and will explicitly state that the argument must be a `relax.Tuple` instead of a `relax.Var`.","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:56:10Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T13:08:38Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T11:31:59Z","merged_at":"2024-08-26T11:31:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4acc79bdec9bd501d1732572843829d7f90c38d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/eaa5d21cae760801be9e6ffc504e5e77202b8cb0","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_avoid_generating_tuple_of_tuples","ref":"relax_avoid_generating_tuple_of_tuples","sha":"eaa5d21cae760801be9e6ffc504e5e77202b8cb0","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

However, this same error message could be also be reached if the input does not have `TensorStructInfo` at all, which would trigger a segfault.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the validation to print the argument's `StructInfo` directly, rather than a field from the struct info.

is a follow-up PR to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16183, which updated the FFI with explicit integer types.  As part of that change, many internal functions were updated to accept non-IR types (e.g. `Array<runtime::Int>` instead of `Array<IntImm>`).  For backwards compatibility with callees that provided the IR types, a specialization of `PackedFuncValueConverter` unwrapped the `IntImm` into a `runtime::Int`.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the backwards-compatibility specialization of `PackedFuncValueConverter`.  Breakages that are found in CI as a result will then be updated at the caller side, removing the need for the backwards-compatibility handler altogether.","created_at":"2024-08-05T14:27:09Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T13:21:06Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/51533a5a7bfa771f6a56319623bc1f6d5d7428d8","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ffi_remove_automatic_intimm_to_runtime_int_conversion","ref":"ffi_remove_automatic_intimm_to_runtime_int_conversion","sha":"51533a5a7bfa771f6a56319623bc1f6d5d7428d8","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16183, which added handling of boolean values in the TVM FFI.  The initial implementation added both a new type code (`kTVMArgBool`) and a new `TVMValue::v_bool` variant.  This commit removes the `TVMValue::v_bool` variant, since the `kTVMArgBool` type code is sufficient to handle boolean arguments.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `TVMValue::v_bool` variant also makes all `TVMValue` variants be 64-bit (assuming a 64-bit CPU).  This can simplify debugging in some cases, since it prevents partial values from inactive variants from being present in memory.","created_at":"2024-08-05T14:17:39Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T17:14:46Z","closed_at":"2024-08-22T17:13:17Z","merged_at":"2024-08-22T17:13:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f037a6d9957108decceaf0c91bd84667a077aad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/be55b64baf9b2b0b9a17c42e302e836b88fe9378","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ffi_use_int64_variant_to_represent_bool","ref":"ffi_use_int64_variant_to_represent_bool","sha":"be55b64baf9b2b0b9a17c42e302e836b88fe9378","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR bumps FlashInfer and updates PagedKVCache accordingly for performance improvement.\r\n\r\nSome notes on this bump:\r\n\r\n* When the Grouped-Query Attention group size is at least 4 and FlashInfer is enabled, we use the prefill attn kernel for better performance.\r\n* We enlarge the temporary workspace for FlashInfer use accordingly, as FlashInfer in the current version may consume much larger workspace. We turn off the workspace when FlashInfer is not enabled.\r\n* We reduce the max block depth to be 2, in observation of the limited help of cascade inference when batch size is not large and the prompt reuse is low.","created_at":"2024-08-02T20:57:27Z","updated_at":"2024-08-03T08:28:02Z","closed_at":"2024-08-03T08:28:02Z","merged_at":"2024-08-03T08:28:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"76b954a09e781b7f664b1d345e1494123c19484c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e6987dff37fcb98683b8d8b8b8fccf68961ed771","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-08-02-bump-flashinfer","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-08-02-bump-flashinfer","sha":"e6987dff37fcb98683b8d8b8b8fccf68961ed771","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

clients.","created_at":"2024-08-01T16:03:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T21:49:02Z","closed_at":"2024-08-02T21:49:01Z","merged_at":"2024-08-02T21:49:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"219ae85d4b58c97b3438fc9c031728c78002d9ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0df6d15783e971d12a473623b56b69d5cc32f256","head":{"label":"Neet-Nestor:main","ref":"main","sha":"0df6d15783e971d12a473623b56b69d5cc32f256","user":{"login":"Neet-Nestor","id":23090573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDkwNTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23090573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor","html_url":"https://github.com/Neet-Nestor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":804614013,"node_id":"R_kgDOL_VvfQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"Neet-Nestor/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Neet-Nestor","id":23090573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDkwNTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23090573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor","html_url":"https://github.com/Neet-Nestor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neet-Nestor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Neet-Nestor/tvm","description":"Open
