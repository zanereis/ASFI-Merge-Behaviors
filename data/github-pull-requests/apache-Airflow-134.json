The confusing part is that the tags filter box will not have any entries in there either. This is what confuses the users where they think there are no filters but there are also no DAGs.\r\n\r\nSince the tags filter box won't allow for tags not used by DAGs, it made more sense to redirect the URL and wipe the tags when there are no valid tags in the query parameters.\r\n\r\nWhen there are valid tags and invalid tags, there will be no redirects since the valid tags do still show up on

But, in some cases, like the one with GitHub codespaces #25251, this imposes a limitation because codespaces forces airflow sources to be located at a different location `/workspaces/airflow` and it can't be changed or configured.

: Pull request # [24084](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24084) added the ability to provide `fnamtch` file pattern to SFTP sensor. But sensor fails to locate the file when the file pattern is provided. \r\n \r\nIssue : Code fails to get modified time once file matching to the given pattern is found. [Line # 77](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/sftp/sensors/sftp.py#L77) from sftp.py file fails with no such file error. \r\n\r\n`mod_time = self.hook.get_mod_time(actual_file_to_check)`\r\n\r\nRoot cause: Code assumes that the `get_file_by_pattern` method returns a complete path for a file matching the given `fnamtch` expression. While we are only getting file name in return. `get_file_by_pattern` internally relies on [Paramiko SFTP clients listdir()](https://docs.paramiko.org/en/stable/api/sftp.html#paramiko.sftp_client.SFTPClient.listdir) method to retrieve files contained in given path folder. `listdir()` method only returns file names and not the complete file path. \r\n\r\nRelated code, sftp.py file [line # 68.](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/sftp/sensors/sftp.py#L68)\r\n`file_from_pattern = self.hook.get_file_by_pattern(self.path, self.file_pattern)`\r\n\r\nFix : Prepending the path to `actual_file_to_check `variable fixes the issue. \r\n\r\n`actual_file_to_check = os.path.join(self.path, file_from_pattern)`\r\n\r\nRelated :

raised by axios (`AxiosError`) are not properly  displayed in the toast. (Cf picture bellow).\r\n\r\n`AxiosError` is a subclass of `Error` and therefore handled as standard `Error`, never reading from `error.response.data` but from `error.message`.\r\n\r\nAdded a check for Error deciding whether to read from `error.message` or `error.response.data`. (and removed the part that was never called after the Error check).\r\n\r\nUpdated the tests accordingly. Axios does not expose a way to construct `AxiosError` manually. (enhanceError, createError, AxiosError are not exposed because they are part of axios core). I constructed a custom object with the correct properties to be considered as an AxiosError from axios type guard (`axios.isAxiosError`). It is similar to what `axios.enhanceError` does. (If you have a better way to construct an `AxiosError`, I'd be glad to take it).\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/184495418-d41f0a0f-57be-4914-8fad-294ba184445c.png)\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/184495012-df0e7262-8bbd-4a09-852d-52cb5b07fcb9.png)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-13T13:08:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:15:33Z","closed_at":"2022-08-13T14:48:06Z","merged_at":"2022-08-13T14:48:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"588fcc0fa7df8a57528dee280240d9880ad5d89a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

PR converts the Helm tests to use the new Python Breeze.\r\nIt has all the features of previous Kind breeze command and more.\r\n\r\nAll the commands are now grupped under k8s group and they are very\r\neasy to use locally (even easier than the previous version).\r\n\r\nThe CI part is also converted and simplified - i.e. the upgrade\r\ntest is now much faster (only tests one upgrade per job and it\r\nruns withing the original Helm/Kubernetes tests jobs so it will\r\nnot have the cluster creation overhead.\r\n\r\nMost importantly - this is almost the last step before we can get\r\nrid of the old legacy breeze code and one that we can get rid of\r\nthe `./breeze-legacy` script because all functionality from the\r\nold breeze has been moved to the Python version with this change.\r\n\r\nThis removl allows us also to remove a lot of the common library\r\nbash code that is not used any more anywhere - even in CI.\r\n\r\nThe only change left is running regular tests in parallel.\r\n\r\nCloses: #23085\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#24401 with more explaination and a test case. Fix #24338.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the part to resolve XCom inputs, the scheduler already made sure the current task's upstreams \"allow\" this task to run (by logic in TriggerRuleDep). So if an upstream does not push a referenced XCom, it should be expected by the user, and therefore not be failed by\r\nAirflow.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the XCom resolution return None instead of raising an exception. This is a reasonable choice since the XCom does not allow pushing None by design, and receiving None can therefore only mean that corresponding XCom push did not happen.","created_at":"2022-08-11T09:24:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:14:04Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T12:05:52Z","merged_at":"2022-08-16T12:05:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4e38978194ef46565bc1e5ba53ecc65308d09aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

from #15277:\r\n\r\n> Resolves https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13158.\r\n> \r\n> As the UI has evolved, it has needed to diverge from the constraints of the aged, secondary Bootstrap dependency (by way of FAB). The alternative Bootstrap themes provided by FAB are no longer working properly, resulting in a sub-par user experience for anyone who might opt to use one. Supporting these themes would require substantial ongoing maintenance overhead.\r\n> \r\n> The alternative themes don't provide a better user experience than the (newly refreshed) UI theme. I could see differentiation between multiple Airflow deployments as the goal for utilizing this feature. In that case, we have the option to set a different nav bar color by setting a color value in the navbar_color config.\r\n> \r\n> While this PR doesn't stop a user (who knows the inner workings of FAB) from configuring an alternative theme, it does ensure that the airflow theme is always loaded. There is no documentation of this feature in the Airflow docs, but this PR also removes comments suggesting usage of it and pointing to the FAB docs.\r\n> \r\n> I've also updated the theme CSS file naming to remove \"default\" so it doesn't suggest that it is something changeable.\r\n\r\nThis needs to wait for Airflow 3.0.","created_at":"2022-08-10T21:44:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T17:32:46Z","closed_at":"2024-10-02T17:32:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e727302bb1868fdcaec9a056adf4ec31999c185c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect from Stalebot auto closing"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1872841889,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcyODQxODg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/dont-merge","name":"dont-merge","color":"a9e8f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

PR just removes a statement that had no effect.\r\n\r\nWe keep sending possibly 'None'  state in the grid data except for the 'mapped_states' count. (None keys in json are an issue)\r\n\r\nI have another version of this PR [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...pierrejeambrun:airflow:fix-task-group-to-grid-no-status), where instead, None status are changed to 'no_status' in the entire returned payload. I don't think this is a good idea because either way the front will still have to handle None state. (Other endpoints returning `TaskInstance` will not do this transformation).\r\n\r\nI plan to work on `grid_data` endpoint to make it return object following the api_connexion.TaskInstance schema. (run_id vs dag_run_id and other differences), to be able to unify those types in the front.

A few more `schedule_interval` changes missed in the previous PR.\r\n* Allow passing in sets and other collection types of dataset triggers (instead of just list).\r\n* Remove documentation on deprecated `schedule_interval` and `timetable`.\r\n* Remove the None case of `dataset_triggers` (not needed; an empty list works just as well).\r\n* Remove `test_zip_invalid_cron.zip` and generate that ZIP file dynamically during tests instead; this helps avoid the file being stale (due to the ZIP content not being

added support for retrieving mapped instance task logs.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for displaying these logs in the Grid details side panel.\r\n- Mapped Instances rows in the table are not selectable anymore. (Actions are done on all of them)\r\n- Mapped Instances rows are clickable and bring a new details page for mapped instances. (We can see the Map Index on top of other detailed information).\r\n- For the new details, logs tab is available and show the logs for this particular map index.\r\n- Breadcrumbs get extended with the map index and the `taskInstance` breadcrumbs becomes clickable in this particular case.\r\n- Extracting tasks actions into its own component.\r\n- Add a button to go back to the dynamic task summary (thanks @bbovenzi)\r\n- Add navigation link the same way we have for normal taks (xcom, details, templates, ...) and remove those links from MappedInstance Table (thanks @bbovenzi)\r\n- Move the MappedInstance Table to its own tab (again thanks @bbovenzi)\r\n- Added a few unit tests.\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n- Mapped Tasks (obviously) :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- Groups with mapped task :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- Logs display, `See More` and `Download` links, and logs filters :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- When there is multiple pages in the `MappedInstances` Table :heavy_check_mark:\r\n- Breadcrumbs navigation :heavy_check_mark:\r\n- Task actions for all mapped task are working :heavy_check_mark:\r\n- Task actions from the details of a mapped task instance does not work with the `SequentialExecutor` but the calls seems fine. (I didn't modify that part)\r\n\r\nAlso fixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25616\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/183724859-8288d983-981f-448a-ada9-6330bef9809a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/183745340-5ef82450-7cd8-4648-b97e-1fcec3301ee1.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-08T17:10:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:15:23Z","closed_at":"2022-08-14T22:36:53Z","merged_at":"2022-08-14T22:36:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"88292837ba219c99f94bf3e03c5befda470c83b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: New Features"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Of course, accessing these mapped-task `XComs` can be done with the typical Jinja template, but having the convenience of using the `output` property would be a \"quality of life\" improvement for DAG authors (especially since task dependencies would then be automatically implemented too).\r\n\r\n~Rather than adding the property to `MappedOperator` and have this property definition exist in two locations (along with `BaseOperator`), I opted to add this to `AbstractOperator` given all tasks have an output even if that output is empty and both `BaseOperator` and `MappedOperator` share the `AbstractOperator` implementation. If there a higher-level reason to have two instances of the property definition, I'm happy to oblige.~\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `output` property to `MappedOperator` and includes a return type annotation for `XComArg`. Additionally, until a more appropriate API implementation of accessing a different `XCom` key from `output` other than \"return_value\" is decided, the example DAGs and system tests using this API have been updated to explicitly use `XComArg(operator, key=...)` instead.\r\n\r\n~TODO:~\r\n~Add docs demonstrating the use of this property with mapped tasks.~ May be handled in

self-upgrade behaved somewhat erratically:\r\n\r\n1) when executed manually as `self-upgrade` it printed \"repaat the\r\n   command\" - which made no sense\r\n\r\n2) whe triggered as part of an environment check (i.e. when breeze\r\n   version was different or installed from another workspaece) it\r\n   upgraded - and also printed \"repeat the command\" - which made\r\n   more sense but added a need to repeat the command.\r\n\r\n3) It asked the user to make the decision - but since reinstallation\r\n   is not very intrusive (just few seonds delay) it makes little sense\r\n   as reinstalling breeze would usually take less time than making\r\n   decision\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it for both cases:\r\n\r\n1) there is no \"repat the command\" when you run self-upgrade command\r\n2) when self-upgrade is triggered as part of another command, the\r\n   original command is automatically re-run (with execvl - so\r\n   replacing previous process) after the self-upgrde completed.\r\n3) reinstalling breeze happens automatically in both cases without\r\n   asking the user.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

now AWS Hooks obtain `boto3.session.Session` usual by call `_get_credentials`. This method return `Tuple[boto3.session.Session, Optional[str]]` and actually not return credentials, only session and `endpoint_url`.\r\n\r\nSince #25336 all hook/connections configs stored in `conn_config` cached property, we do not need to call `_get_credentials` to obtain `endpoint_url` as well as other connection attributes.\r\n\r\nAlso change all aws hooks which uses this `_get_credentials`.\r\n\r\nRight now (main branch) other providers do not use this method directly, however current version of PostgreSQL provider use this method (#25424), so we can't remove `_get_credentials`.\r\n\r\nSome minor changes - remove information about that S3 Bucket has not region (#20463). In fact AWS S3 Buckets has region in other hand you could access to any buckets from any region if you have a permission (might be only one limitation endpoint should be in the same AWS Region

PR adds support for retrieving task logs for mapped task.\r\n\r\nYou can now provide an additional query_param `map_index` that default to -1 (for unmapped task).\r\n\r\nAdded a few tests as well.\r\n\r\n(Before this, the endpoint would just throw an internal error because of multiple rows matching the `one_or_none` [query](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/log_endpoint.py#L76))\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to be able to bring logs tab to the mapped task in the Grid UI. (Follow up PR is coming for the front-end part)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

change will allow to experiment with other base images\r\n(for example CentOS that our users highly demand) but also\r\nit has a few nice simplifications and improvements along\r\nthe way:\r\n\r\n* no more runtime parameters for CI image (they only make\r\n  sense for PROD image)\r\n* no more support for Buster image (it is end of life in August)\r\n* Dockerfile has now less embedded default values (most of them\r\n  moved to inlined bash script)\r\n* configuration for yarn sources is removed (we do not need yarn\r\n  any more in our images)\r\n* additional pure-dev dependencies in CI image are passed through\r\n  ADDITIONAL_DEV_DEPS\r\n* dev installation does not remove installation cache, making\r\n  the CI image slightly bigger but easier for devel use - to install new\r\n  dependencies (no need for `apt-get update` before installation)\r\n* latest patchlevels of various tools we use for CI were bumped\r\n\r\nBased on top of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25582 - please change only last commit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
