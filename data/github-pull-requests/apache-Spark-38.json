for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, only the pod annotations supports `APP_ID` and `EXECUTOR_ID` placeholders. This commit aims to add the same function to pod labels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe use case is to support using customized labels for availability zone based topology pod affinity. We want to use the Spark application ID as the customized label value, to allow Spark executor pods to run in the same availability zone as Spark driver pod.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can use the Spark internal label `spark-app-selector` directly, this is not a good practice when using it along with YuniKorn Gang Scheduling. When Gang Scheduling is enabled, the YuniKorn placeholder pods should use the same affinity as real Spark pods. In this way, we have to add the internal `spark-app-selector` label to the placeholder pods. This is not good because the placeholder pods could be recognized as Spark pods in the monitoring system.\r\n\r\nThus we propose supporting the `APP_ID` and `EXECUTOR_ID` placeholders in Spark pod labels as well for flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo because the pattern strings are very specific.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to improve `toUpperCase` & `toLowerCase` with` Locale.ROOT` rules, includes:\r\n- improve the rule `caselocale` in file `scalastyle-config.xml` to make matching `more accurate`, eg: `xxx.toLowerCase()` was previously unrecognizable, but now it can be recognized.\r\n- align the usage specifications of `toUpperCase & toLowerCase with Locale.ROOT` between the `Java side` and `Scala side`, which were not previously established on the `Java side`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake our rules more accurate and aligned on the `Java side` and `Scala side`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, only for developers (Especially for Java developers).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-20T04:26:12Z","updated_at":"2024-08-03T00:20:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-03T00:20:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3492e22fcb883ba085aa9a3b0c23f1f1f6e15a0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12d94eaf491f0da6c8c6e59d88411279686bc812","head":{"label":"panbingkun:java_toXXXCase","ref":"java_toXXXCase","sha":"12d94eaf491f0da6c8c6e59d88411279686bc812","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges the filter pushDown optimizer to not push down past projections of the same element if we reasonable expect that computing that element is likely to be expensive.\r\n\r\nThis is a more complex alternative to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45802 which also moves parts of projections down so that the filters can move further down.\r\n\r\nThis introduces an \"expectedCost\" mechanism which we may or may not want. Previous filter ordering work used filter pushdowns as an approximation of expression cost but here we need more granularity. As an alternative we could introduce a flag for expensive rather than numeric operations. Another alternative would be seeing if the predicate can be \"converted\" as a proxy for cheap.\r\n\r\n### Future Work / What else remains to do?\r\n\r\nRight now if a cond is expensive and it references something in the projection we don't push-down. We could probably do better and gate this on if the thing we are reference is expensive rather than the condition it's self. We could do this as a follow up item or as part of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark may double compute expensive operations (like json parsing, UDF eval, etc.) as a result of filter pushdown past projections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSQL optimizer change may impact some user queries, results should be the same and hopefully a little faster.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests were added to the FilterPushDownSuite, and the initial problem of double evaluation was confirmed with a github gist \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade the minimum version of `arrow` R package to 10.0.0 like PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark `master` branch tests only with the latest R package which is `15.0.1` as of now. To avoid any incompatibility issues across R and Python, we had better use the same minimum policy.\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/apache/apache-spark-ci-image:master-8755911327 R -e 'installed.packages()' | grep arrow | head -n1\r\narrow        \"arrow\"        \"/usr/local/lib/R/site-library\" \"15.0.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but most SparkR users has been using the latest one which is higher than 10.0.0 because `Arrow R package 10.0.0` was released 2022-10-26 and has been used over one and half years.\r\n- https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/arrow/\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-19T23:11:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-20T02:58:33Z","closed_at":"2024-04-20T02:58:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7462cfd36e53d40211018281b104c3b19b435b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4274e32155d7d6ac6663df9c05a5645ef708ef22","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47923","ref":"SPARK-47923","sha":"4274e32155d7d6ac6663df9c05a5645ef708ef22","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull request implements the `try_parse_json` that runs `parse_json` on string expressions to extract variants. However, if `parse_json` throws an exception on a row, the value `null` is returned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes, columns containing JSON strings may contain some invalid inputs that should be ignored instead of having the whole execution failed because of it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it allows users to run the `try_parse_json` expression.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests to check if `try_parse_json` works just like `parse_json` on valid inputs, returns `null` on invalid inputs, and fails on incorrect input data types.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRecently a bug was fixed in the lexer which equated ! (bang) with NOT. The original bug allowed for unintended syntax such as:\r\nCREATE TABLE IF ! EXISTS TY(c1 INT ! NULL)\r\nand also, slightly less iffy: c1 ! IN (1, 2)\r\n\r\nIt turns out this undocumented \"feature\" can be found in the wild with examples of `! LIKE`, `! BETWEEN` and `! IN`.\r\nSo we need to provide a safety valve by allowing users to re-enable the bug, at least for a while.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes (The original bugfix does, here we make it offical)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded automated  testcases for both modes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

For example,\r\n\r\n- Hive beeline(spark thriftserver)\r\n  - For primitive binaries, we pass the binary directly to the clients, and then the clients will convert the binary based on the option`convertBinaryArrayToString`\r\n    - when convertBinaryArrayToString is true, results in UTF8 encoded strings, `[83, 112, 97, 114, 107] -> \"Spark\"`\r\n    - when convertBinaryArrayToString is false, Hive3-beeline results in comma-separated byte strings, `[83, 112, 97, 114, 107] -> [83, 112, 97, 114, 107]` Hive4-beeline, a base64 encoded string, `[83, 112, 97, 114, 107] -> U3Bhcmsg`\r\n  - For nested binaries, we pass the binary as UTF8 encoded strings\r\n- Spark SQL CLI\r\n  - For both primitive and nested binaries, we print UTF8-encoded strings\r\n\r\n- Spark Shell  / pyspark shell \r\n  - We do a special `cast` to convert the binary to a string in space-separated hexadecimal format, `[83, 112, 97, 114, 107] -> \"[53 70 61 72 6b]\"`\r\n\r\n**Given that no two behaviors are compatible or consistent, this could take you a lot of time to digest.**\r\n\r\nBesides Apache Hive, other modern databases like Postgres, and MySQL, also support different binary output formats. The hexadecimal format is the most recommended format for binary output. `[83, 112, 97, 114, 107] -> \"(0x)537061726b\"`\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14786\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-23856\r\n- https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients\r\n- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-binary.html#DATATYPE-BINARY-BYTEA-HEX-FORMAT\r\n- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/mysql-command-options.html#option_mysql_binary-as-hex\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- A universal BinaryFormatter for consistensy\r\n- A configuration for flexibility to align with Hive or other systems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, we have introduced a new configuration spark.sql.binaryOutputStyle but the AS-IS behavior is kept.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFile format of insert overwrite dir does not take effect.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n```\r\nset hive.default.fileformat=parquet;\r\n\r\n-- Not as expected, I want an orc file but generated a parquet file.\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '$tablePath'\r\nSTORED AS\r\n  INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat'\r\n  OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcOutputFormat'\r\nselect 1;\r\n\r\n-- Failed\r\nselect * from `orc`.`$tablePath`; \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we use stored as fileformat to insert directory, `InsertIntoDir.storage.serde` will be set to `parquet` which is default fileformat serde class we set, and then `RelationConversions` optimizer will convert `InsertIntoDir` to `InsertIntoDataSourceDirCommand` causing the fileformat classes we specified to be ignored.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nclose stream when DiskBlockObjectWriter closeResources to avoid memory leak\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[SPARK-34647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34647) replaced the ZstdInputStream with ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer. This meant that all usages of CompressionCodec.compressedOutputStream would need to manually close the stream as this would no longer be handled by the finalizer mechanism.\r\nWhen using zstd for shuffle write compression, if for some reason the execution of this process is interrupted(eg. enable spark.sql.execution.interruptOnCancel and cancel Job). The memory used by `ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer` may not be freed, causing a memory leak.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n#### Spark Shell Configuration\r\n```\r\n$> export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS=\"-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -Xms1g\"\r\n$> $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --conf spark.io.compression.codec=zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Test Script\r\n```scala\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit\r\nimport scala.concurrent.Future\r\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\n\r\nsc.setJobGroup(\"jobA\", \"this is a job to be cancelled\", interruptOnCancel = true)\r\n(1 to 50).foreach { batch

val df2 = spark.range(2000000).map { _ =>(Random.nextString(20),Random.nextInt(1000),Random.nextInt(1000),Random.nextInt(10))}.toDF(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\")\r\n    df1.join(df2,\"b\").show()  }\r\n  Thread.sleep(5000)\r\n  sc.cancelJobGroup(\"jobA\")\r\n}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Memory Monitor\r\n```\r\n$> while true; do echo \\\"$(date +%Y-%m-%d' '%H:%M:%S)\\\",$(pmap -x <PID> | grep \"total

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have a parent `pyspark.sql.DataFrame` class which `pyspark.sql.connect.dataframe.DataFrame` and `pyspark.sql.classic.dataframe.DataFrame` inherit.\r\n\r\n**Note** that for backward compatibility concern, `pyspark.sql.DataFrame(...)` will return still a Spark Classic DataFrame.\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n1. `pyspark.sql.DataFrame` (Spark Claasic)\r\n    - docstrings\r\n    - Spark Classic logic\r\n\r\n2. `pyspark.sql.connect.dataframe.DataFrame` (Spark Connect)\r\n    - Spark Connect logic\r\n\r\n3. Users can only see the type hints from `pyspark.sql.DataFrame`.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n1. `pyspark.sql.DataFrame` (Common)\r\n    - docstrings\r\n    - Support classmethod usages (dispatch to either Spark Connect or Spark Classic)\r\n\r\n2. `pyspark.sql.classic.dataframe.DataFrame` (Spark Classic)\r\n    - Spark Classic logic\r\n\r\n3. `pyspark.sql.connect.dataframe.DataFrame` (Spark Connect)\r\n    - Spark Connect logic\r\n\r\n4. Users can only see the type hints from `pyspark.sql.DataFrame`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis fixes two issues in the current structure at Spark Connect:\r\n\r\nSupport usage of regular methods as class methods, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame\r\ndf = spark.range(10)\r\nDataFrame.union(df, df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 4809, in union\r\n    return DataFrame(self._jdf.union(other._jdf), self.sparkSession)\r\n                     ^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/dataframe.py\", line 1724, in __getattr__\r\n    raise PySparkAttributeError(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkAttributeError: [JVM_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_SUPPORTED] Attribute `_jdf` is not supported in Spark Connect as it depends on the JVM. If you need to use this attribute, do not use Spark Connect when creating your session. Visit https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-getting-started.html#starting-point-sparksession for creating regular Spark Session in detail.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n```\r\nDataFrame[id: bigint]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupports `isinstance` call\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame\r\nisinstance(spark.range(1), DataFrame)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n```\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n```\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as described above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and CI should verify them.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `enableStableIdentifiersForUnionType` is enabled, all of the types are lowercased which creates a problem when field types are case-sensitive: \r\n\r\nUnion type with fields:\r\n```\r\nSchema.createEnum(\"myENUM\", \"\", null, List[String](\"E1\", \"e2\").asJava),\r\nSchema.createRecord(\"myRecord2\", \"\", null, false, List[Schema.Field](new Schema.Field(\"F\", Schema.create(Type.FLOAT))).asJava)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct<member_myenum: string, member_myrecord2: struct<f: float>> \r\n```\r\n\r\nbut instead should be \r\n```\r\nstruct<member_myENUM: string, member_myRecord2: struct<F: float>> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug of lowercasing the field name (the type portion).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, if a user enables `enableStableIdentifiersForUnionType` and has Union types, all fields will preserve the case. Previously, the field names would be all in lowercase.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a test case to verify the new field names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-18T22:45:28Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T20:15:18Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T21:16:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"622d65fee7bacdfc7c67a2c93badd71aee1c74f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/925a28758100641e9e3a2fe5f31757954862e67b","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-47904","ref":"SPARK-47904","sha":"925a28758100641e9e3a2fe5f31757954862e67b","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change was made to propagate errors in PySpark foreachBatch worker initialization to the user, which can happen if the UDF isn't serializable or deserializable. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the foreachBatch function isn't serializable, previously we were not propagating this error to the user, and instead were failing with an ambiguous SparkConnectGrpcException (while the real error was being written to stderr). With this change, we will send the error message to the user with a more specific error message about worker initialization failure. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, we are simply propagating the error to the user instead of just writing the error to stderr.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUsing unit tests and a notebook with the change. \r\nStack trace before change:\r\n```\r\nSparkConnectGrpcException: (java.io.EOFException) \r\nFile <command-41186175708098>, line 27\r\n      def fcn(batch, id):\r\n          print(obj)\r\n       q = (df.select(\"value\")\r\n          .writeStream\r\n          .foreachBatch(fcn)\r\n--->       .start())\r\n```\r\n\r\nStack trace after change:\r\n```\r\nSparkConnectGrpcException: (java.lang.RuntimeException) Runner initialization failed (returned -2).

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe previous PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45487 \r\nThe previous PR modified the parser to ignore CDATA within rowTag elements which results in missed data during parsing. \r\n\r\nThese changes add the following:\r\n1. Changed to not ignore CDATA within row tags (only CDATA outside of a row is ignored).\r\n2. Changed the existing tests to reflect that CDATA within row tags is not ignored.\r\n3. Added one more test to test CDATA within a row.\r\n\r\nThe new test case includes this:\r\n\r\n`<ROW><![CDATA[ <ROW>3</ROW> ]]></ROW>`\r\n\r\nThis actually parses correctly because both start and end tag are within the CDATA, but if one of them was missing it would break. For example, the following would break:\r\n\r\n`<ROW><![CDATA[ 3</ROW> ]]></ROW>`\r\n\r\nFuture work should allow the case above to pass by not matching to row tags within CDATA.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect XML parsing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nCDATA outside of a row is now ignored, CDATA within a row is not ignored.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a followed of [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44261) PR that made \"compute current time\" family of expressions `Unevaluable`. Implicitly, all `Unevaluable` expressions are also not foldable. Hence, we have a regression comparing to state prior to 44261 where \"compute current time\" expressions could have been used in places where constant folding is required.\r\n\r\nProposed change is to keep these expression `Unevaluable` in a sense that `eval`/`codeGen`  can't be called but to allow folding. This is a special case given that these expressions are supposed to be replaced by QO with literals (that are foldable) so proposal is to create new interface for this family of expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExplained above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdditional test is added that ensures that `CurrentDate` can be used in places that require folding.\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix method name and logic for cases where we want to check if the string has the UTF8 binary (implicit) collation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#45592 introduced session level collation which meant that the concept of default collation is not the same as the implicit collation. Method in `SchemaUtils` had its name and logic changed to mean that the collation is binary orderable but that was not it's original intent. It should check if the collation is not  implicit/UTF8 binary (`id != 0`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix `ExpressionSet` performance regression in scala 2.12.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the `SetLike.++` method in scala 2.12 is to iteratively execute the `+` method. The `ExpressionSet.+` method first clones a new object and then adds element, which is very expensive.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/blob/ceaf7e68ac93e9bbe8642d06164714b2de709c27/src/library/scala/collection/SetLike.scala#L186\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36121, the `++` and `--` methods in ExpressionSet of scala 2.12 were removed, causing performance regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issues introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45989:\r\n- `VariantBuilder.appendBinary` incorrectly uses the type tag for the string type.\r\n- `VariantExpressionEvalUtils.buildVariant` misses the decimal types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is a bug fix and allows Spark to read a map schema with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46071. When parsing a JSON object as a map or struct, the `JacksonParser` only peeks the `FIELD_NAME` token without consuming it. `VariantBuilder.parseJson` will then fail because the current token is `FIELD_NAME` rather than the starting token of the value. Previous tests with struct schemas didn't fail because the parsing error was caught and the parser would then consume the field name, and the field value would be read in the next iteration. However, a map schema with variant value would fail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is a bug fix and allows Spark to read a map schema with variant value (for example, `map<string, variant>`) correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test. It would fail without the changes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to switch `ANSI SQL` GitHub Action job to `NON-ANSI SQL` GitHub Action job.\r\n- Rename `build_ansi.yml` to `build_non_ansi.yml`\r\n- Change job name from `ANSI` to `NON-ANSI`\r\n- Change `SPARK_ANSI_SQL_MODE` to `false`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-44111, Apache Spark uses ANSI mode by default. So, we need to switch this to keep `NON-ANSI SQL` mode test coverage.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46013\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review. This should be tested after merging.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [the previous PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46012), we cache plans of AnalyzePlan requests. We're also enabling it for ExecutePlan in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome operations like spark.sql() issue ExecutePlan requests. By caching them, we can also improve performance if subsequent plans to be analyzed include the plan returned by ExecutePlan as a subtree.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove docstring of mapInArrow:\r\n\r\n- \"using a Python native function that takes and outputs a PyArrow's RecordBatch\" is confusing cause the function takes and outputs \"ITERATOR of RecordBatchs\" instead.\r\n- \"All columns are passed together as an iterator of pyarrow.RecordBatchs\" easily mislead users to think the entire DataFrame will be passed together, \"a batch of rows\" is used instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore accurate and clear docstring.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nDoc change only.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen writing table schema to hive stop writing collated strings as `string COLLATE name` but instead just write them as regular `string` type as hive doesn't support collations.\r\n\r\nSince we write the original schema as json to table properties in hive so we will able to read the collation back.\r\n\r\nAlso when reading back the table from the catalog, aside from ignoring case and nullability we should now also ignore any differences in string types as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn order to not break hive compatibility with external engines using hive that would otherwise fail to parse this new type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded hand-crafted implementations of unicode-aware lower-case `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith` to optimize UTF8_BINARY_LCASE for ASCII-only strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`UTF8String.toLowerCase()`, which is used for the aforementioned collation-aware functions, has an optimization for full-ascii strings, but still always allocates a new object. In this PR I introduced loop-based implementations, which fall-back to `toLowerCase()` in case they meet a non-asci character.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, these functions should behave exactly as:\r\n- `lhs.containsInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().contains(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n- `lhs.startsWithInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().startsWith(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n- `lhs.endsWithInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().endsWith(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test cases to `org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CollationSupportSuite` and `org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8StringSuite`, including several unicode lowercase specific. Also I've run `CollationBenchmark` on GHA for JDK 17 and JDK 21 and have updated the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse V2Predicate to wrap If expr when building v2 expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `PushFoldableIntoBranches` optimizer may fold predicate into (if / case) branches and `V2ExpressionBuilder` wraps `If` as `GeneralScalarExpression`, which causes the assertion in `PushablePredicate.unapply` to fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDuring the PruneFileSourcePartitions process, we can optimize by casting the dataType of the constant to match the dataType of the corresponding partition key.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSuppose we have a partitioned table `table_pt` with partition colum `dt` which is StringType and the table metadata is managed by Hive Metastore, if we filter partition by dt = '123', this filter can be pushed down to data source directly, but if the filter condition is number, e.g. dt = 123, Spark will not known which partition should be pushed down. Thus in the process of physical plan optimization, Spark will pull all of that table's partition meta data to client side, to decide which partition filter should be push down to the data source. This is poor of performance if the table has thousands of partitions and increasing the risk of hive metastore oom. In our production env, we encounter this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nin our production env, this fix is OK\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-04-16T06:57:58Z","updated_at":"2024-08-04T00:23:17Z","closed_at":"2024-08-04T00:23:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5460b23009af2164cde0c8b807ca287e4da5892","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c28b6faf11b2ba0589295c71ae03879941ffe132","head":{"label":"lastbus:branch-3.5-hive-partition-filter-pushdown-optimize","ref":"branch-3.5-hive-partition-filter-pushdown-optimize","sha":"c28b6faf11b2ba0589295c71ae03879941ffe132","user":{"login":"lastbus","id":12373096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12373096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus","html_url":"https://github.com/lastbus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52968045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjk2ODA0NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"lastbus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lastbus","id":12373096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12373096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus","html_url":"https://github.com/lastbus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lastbus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lastbus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes test_parity_listener run faster.\r\n\r\nThe test was slow because of `TestListenerSparkV1` and `TestListenerSparkV2` makes server calls and has long wait time, and the test runs on both listeners. They were created to verify the listener function with and without the new `onQueryIdle` callback.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the slowness by removing the V1 and V2 of that listener (now only a `TestListenerSpark`), and create lightweight `TestListenerLocalV1` and `TestListenerLocalV2` for the `onQueryIdle` verification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFaster and more stable ci\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\ntest only change\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nno","created_at":"2024-04-16T04:09:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T23:50:10Z","closed_at":"2024-04-16T23:50:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b1f1c63f3bdc8616e6edd688c29cb37b89a6000","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the variant type in the JSON scan.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR we introduce one new JSON option: `spark.read.format(\"json\").option(\"singleVariantColumn\", \"colName\")`. Setting this option specifies that each JSON document should be ingested into a single variant column called `colName`. When this option is used, the user must not specify a schema, and the schema is inferred as `colName variant`.\r\n\r\n### Example 1 (multiple variant fields)\r\n\r\nJSON files can be ingested into variant fields, e.g.\r\n```\r\nspark.read.format(\"json\").schema(\"i int, var variant, arr ARRAY<variant>\").load(\"a.json\").show(false)\r\n```\r\nfor a file with the following data:\r\n```\r\n{\"i\": 1, \"var\": {\"d\": \"+94875-04-12\", \"string\":\"string1\",\"int\":1,\"array\":[1,2,3],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value1\"}}, \"arr\": [{\"a\": 1}, {\"b\": 2}, {\"c\": 3, \"d\": [1, 2, 3]}]}\r\n{\"i\": 2, \"var\": {\"string\":\"string2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[2,4,6],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value2\"}}}\r\n{}\r\n{\"i\": 3}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2 (one variant field)\r\n\r\nHere's another example with a single variant field:\r\n```\r\nspark.read.format(\"json\").schema(\"var variant\").load(\"a.json\").show(false)\r\n```\r\nfor a file with the following data:\r\n```\r\n{\"var\": {\"d\": \"+94875-04-12\", \"string\":\"string1\",\"int\":1,\"array\":[1,2,3],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value1\"}}}\r\n{\"var\": {\"string\":\"string2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[2,4,6],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value2\"}}}\r\n{}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 3 (singleVariantColumn option)\r\nEach JSON document can also be ingested into a single variant column, e.g.\r\n```\r\nspark.read.format(\"json\").option(\"singleVariantColumn\", \"var\").load(\"a.json\").show(false)\r\n```\r\nfor a file with the following data:\r\n```\r\n{\"i\": 1, \"var\": {\"d\": \"+94875-04-12\", \"string\":\"string1\",\"int\":1,\"array\":[1,2,3],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value1\"}}, \"arr\": [{\"a\": 1}, {\"b\": 2}, {\"c\": 3, \"d\": [1, 2, 3]}]}\r\n{\"i\": 2, \"var\": {\"string\":\"string2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[2,4,6],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value2\"}}}\r\n{}\r\n{\"i\": 3}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt allows Spark to ingest variant values directly from the JSON data source. Previously, the `parse_json` expression can only operate on a string column that is already in an existing table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests that verify the result and error reporting in JSON scan.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-16T02:17:17Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T07:47:32Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T07:47:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2bd4ddbab49ad4b055892c3a866a02bd09cb697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3fe6e771a5b6b193cdb87ff52b17606bed27945","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:json_scan_variant","ref":"json_scan_variant","sha":"c3fe6e771a5b6b193cdb87ff52b17606bed27945","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46027))\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExpired sessions are regularly checked and cleaned up by a maintenance thread. However, currently, this process is synchronous. Therefore, in rare cases, interrupting the execution thread of a query in a session can take hours, causing the entire maintenance process to stall, resulting in a large amount of memory not being cleared.\r\n\r\nWe address this by introducing asynchronous callbacks for execution cleanup, avoiding synchronous joins of execution threads, and preventing the maintenance thread from stalling in the above scenarios. To be more specific, instead of calling `runner.join()` in `ExecutorHolder.close()`, we set a post-cleanup function as the callback through `runner.processOnCompletion`, which will be called asynchronously once the execution runner is completed or interrupted. In this way, the maintenance thread won't get blocked on joining an execution thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases mentioned above, performance can be severely affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and a new test `Async cleanup callback gets called after the execution is closed` in `ReattachableExecuteSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-15T12:36:24Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T13:09:22Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T13:09:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afeda8c0549e9b54b6eb56681f3be24cab2b317f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40790a4380e376cee8ea7fc0e9abf47e205f8675","head":{"label":"xi-db:SPARK-47819-async-cleanup-3.5","ref":"SPARK-47819-async-cleanup-3.5","sha":"40790a4380e376cee8ea7fc0e9abf47e205f8675","user":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":757362931,"node_id":"R_kgDOLSRw8w","name":"spark","full_name":"xi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db/spark","description":"Apache

Why are the changes needed?\r\nRunning some of the tests repetitively have shown that there is an edge case in which the progress reporting yields undesired behavior. This is in particular the case when the response sender loop has already sent the last expected message in the stream to indicate that the stream is finished, but the response sender would send at least one additional progress message.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes this race condition and guarantees that the `ResultComplete` message is the last message on the stream.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded an additional UT, but existing tests cover the race condition.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or
