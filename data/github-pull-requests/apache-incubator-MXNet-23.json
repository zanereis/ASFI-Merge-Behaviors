are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nOps falling in the category of multi_* and preloaded_multi_* were notorious\r\nThey don't have standard keyworded arguments (data=data)\r\nThey expect variable positional args (*data)\r\nIt was previously handled such that only 1 value of variable positional arg could be passed\r\n\r\nNow, you can pass as many values for positional args as you want.\r\nHowever for running run_performance_test, inputs have to be key:value pair\r\n\r\nThat is handled as args0, args1, arg2, etc\r\nSo as long as the name of the key starts with args it will be considered as input for the operator.\r\n\r\nThis is a very rare case that the operator doesn't take keyworded args. Most other ops in MXNet NDArray namespace take keyworded args.","created_at":"2020-02-07T11:47:27Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T23:25:35Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T06:30:04Z","merged_at":"2020-02-13T06:30:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"93c123daee0241845c3e7f6452f91ab2d3d144c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement all Linear Algebra operators in OpPerf. To achieve this, I created a file (`benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/linalg_operators.py`) with a function (`run_linalg_operators_benchmarks`) to run all Linear Algebra ops. Within this function, I used calls to `run_performance_test` for the linalg ops with specific requirements on input data values and a call to a new function I wrote (`get_all_linalg_operators`) in conjunction with `run_op_benchmarks` for all other linalg ops. I also added a call to `run_linalg_operators_benchmarks` in `opperf.py`.\r\n\r\nI also disabled backwards runs on ops that do not support them (`linalg_gelqf`, `linalg_slogdet`, `moments`).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- A benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/linalg_operators.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/opperf.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/rules/default_params.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/benchmark_utils.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/op_registry_utils.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1. Checkout branch and call function `run_linalg_operators_benchmarks` - runs all Linear Algebra ops on relevant data\r\n2. Checkout branch and run `opperf.py` (full run of all ops)\r\n\r\n## Performance Results ##\r\n[Group of operator test - all linalg ops (CPU)](https://gist.github.com/connorgoggins/39cfe77a4d33099d8eb9acc311b2d780)\r\n[Full OpPerf test (CPU)](https://gist.github.com/connorgoggins/c07b18d2b4f3123bf756f299df664ff5)\r\n\r\n[Group of operator test - all linalg ops (GPU)](https://gist.github.com/connorgoggins/1a57724611c47235e225346d1b9ac1e4)\r\n[Full OpPerf test (GPU)](https://gist.github.com/connorgoggins/f44b4873af0902faf5ff044061382ef9)\r\n\r\n@apeforest @access2rohit @ChaiBapchya \r\n","created_at":"2020-02-05T19:05:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T20:41:47Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T20:41:47Z","merged_at":"2020-02-10T20:41:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5d1574307ee78d88245160cc9f46134e19cc802","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR is waiting for code review"},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nCurrently, if `USE_CUDA=ON` but architecture detection fails due to building on a machine without GPU, we will build for `3.0;3.5;5.0;5.2;6.0;6.1;7.0;7.0+PTX;7.5;7.5+PTX`. Thereby we create too large object files, triggering https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16852.\r\n\r\nThus, this PR introduces patched `select_compute_arch.cmake`, such that the fallback arches are `3.0;5.0;5.2;6.0;6.1;7.0;7.5`, ie. dropping PTX and 3.5 so that #16852 is not triggered.\r\nWe don't need 3.5, because code compiled for 3.0 also runs on 3.5 hardware and 3.5 hardware is 7 years old. If someone really cares about performance on 3.5, they can still manually set `MXNET_CUDA_ARCH=3.5`.\r\n\r\nUpstream bug https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/20275\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n-

Description ##\r\n- Fix Makefile problem that build directory may not be present when compiling custom operator sample libraries.\r\n- Fix inaccurate time measurement in test_relu.py example\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement all miscellaneous (not fitting into preexisting categories) operators in OpPerf. To achieve this, I created a file (`benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/misc_operators.py`) with a function (`run_mx_misc_operators_benchmarks`) to run all miscellaneous ops. Within this function, I used calls to `run_performance_test` for the misc ops with positional arguments and a call to a new function I wrote (`get_remaining_miscellaneous_operators`) in conjunction with `run_op_benchmarks` for the misc ops with keyword args. I also added a call to `run_mx_misc_operators_benchmarks` in `opperf.py`.\r\n\r\nI also added functionality to disable backwards runs on ops that do not support them (`SequenceLast`) and registered a custom operator inline to test the `Custom` op.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- A benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/misc_operators.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/opperf.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/rules/default_params.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/benchmark_utils.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/op_registry_utils.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1. Checkout branch and call function `run_mx_misc_operators_benchmarks` - runs all misc ops on relevant data\r\n2. Checkout branch and run `opperf.py` (full run of all ops)\r\n\r\n## Performance Results ##\r\n[Group of operator test - all misc ops

Description ##\r\nThis is a follow-up pr of #17097. It aims to reduce the imperative invoke overhead with tvm ffi when cython is enabled. I implemented `np.zeros` as a demo. Currently the data types supported by the new ffi are\r\n- tuple and list\r\n- str\r\n- Number\r\n\r\nThe details and performance comparison can be seen at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+FFI+for+Operator+Imperative+Invocation .\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13956\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Fix calling abort() on newer compilers\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n[Current assumption](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13956#issuecomment-457893146) is that `DMLC_LOG_FATAL_THROW` needs to be explicitly set to 0 to enable `abort()` on `CHECK` failure, but this assumption seems false.

Description ##\r\nAdd numpy operator mx.np.random.weibull. This is the numpy random number generator for the Weibull distribution (via inversion).\r\nWeibull distribution can be used similarly to Gumbel as a \"Weibull trick\".\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04161.pdf\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\n\r\nCurrently, MXNet supports only ancient Scala 2.11. This prevents using the library in the Scala community.  I found mentions of try to add support of Scala 2.12 but looks like the trial was failed, although PR was merged. This PR is another try.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- API compatibility was completely saved\r\n- Add `scala-2.11`,  `scala-2.12` and `scala-2.13` Maven profiles. Now one of the profiles should be active. This condition is checked by `maven-enforcer-plugin`\r\n- Add Support of Scala 2.13 collections to C++ JNI code\r\n- Module \"Examples\" builds only for 2.11. Dependencies were obsolete and there is no way to port examples without rewriting of logic (this is out of scope of the PR)\r\n- Module \"Spark ML\" builds only for 2.11. It depends on Spark 1.6.3 which supports only 2.11\r\n- *Possible performance degradation in 2.13 version*. Scala 2.13 has new collections library. Default `Seq` is immutable now, so I need to ivoke `toSeq` for each `ArrayBuffer` to copy it to immutable sequence\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### To solve ###\r\n\r\n1. [ ] I did something and `BertQA` starts to compile (looks like it was ignored before). It breaks compilation of examples. I don't know what to do.

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement the remaining operators from the Random Sampling category (`BilinearSampler`, `GridGenerator`, and `sample_multinomial`) in opperf. To achieve this, I added a list to track ops requiring `custom_data` in `op_registry_utils.py` (same strategy @ChaiBapchya used) and added the new random sampling ops to the list, which allowed me to add custom data dimensions for each new op in `default_params.py`. I then added these new ops to the comments in `random_sampling_operators.py`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I investigated the `sample_multinomial` op, a Random Sampling op which had previously been added to the `unique_ops` tuple in `op_registry_utils.py`. This inclusion of the op in `unique_ops` effectively removed the op from opperf. While the documentation claimed that this op only worked when all values on the last axis summed to 1, I tested the op extensively and found that the op did in fact work on random data. With this in mind, I added this op to opperf and assigned its data parameter to lower dimensional data than the standard data shape to facilitate quick testing (on the standard data shape, the op took several minutes to complete a single forward pass).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/random_sampling_operators.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/op_registry_utils.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/rules/default_params.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement the remaining operators from the GEMM category in opperf. To achieve this, I added a call to `run_performance_test` for the `khatri_rao` op within the `run_gemm_operators_benchmarks` function and, since `khatri_rao` has yet to be implemented for GPU, added a check to ensure that the context was GPU before running benchmarks for `khatri_rao`. Since `khatri_rao` was the only remaining op in the GEMM ops category, these were the only required changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/gemm_operators.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1. Checkout branch and call function `run_gemm_operators_benchmarks` - runs all gemm ops (`dot`, `batch_dot`, and `khatri_rao`) on relevant data\r\n2. Checkout branch and run `opperf.py` (full run of all ops)\r\n\r\n## Performance Results ##\r\n[Group of operator test - all GEMM ops

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement the remaining operators from the nn_conv category in opperf. To achieve this, I added a call to `run_performance_test` for the `ROIPooling` op within the `run_pooling_operators_benchmarks` function and added the `rois` argument to the NDArray list in `default_params.py`. Since `ROIPooling` was the only remaining op in the convolutional ops category, these were the only changes required.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/nn_conv_operators.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/rules/default_params.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1. Checkout branch and call function `run_pooling_operators_benchmarks` - runs all pooling ops (`Pooling` and `ROIPooling`) on relevant data\r\n2. Checkout branch and run `opperf.py` (full run of all ops)\r\n\r\n## Performance Results ##\r\n[Group of operator test - all Pooling ops

Fix errors like: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Funix-gpu/detail/PR-17489/2/pipeline\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-31T20:38:41Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T09:27:26Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T06:10:31Z","merged_at":"2020-02-07T06:10:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cac78608f70fb33eca6af90a081d05a733bc32f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f8ec63e7add4adef6f3d1507e80f86f001260759","head":{"label":"haojin2:flaky_conv_multi_streams","ref":"flaky_conv_multi_streams","sha":"f8ec63e7add4adef6f3d1507e80f86f001260759","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description\r\nImprove the custom operator example doc by adding how to write GPU custom operator.\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of the CustomOp tutorial doc #17241 \r\n\r\n## This PR is not\r\n- Updating docs on the MXNet website on extending MXNet\r\n- Consolidating operator related docs on the website\r\n\r\nThose will be addressed in the coming PRs\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-30T19:51:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T01:46:42Z","closed_at":"2020-02-16T02:28:50Z","merged_at":"2020-02-16T02:28:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"99d57737e7bc0aff8c0bcbb976445203a2c4c192","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\nA temporary solution of [#17327](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17327) to support the gather_nd operation for `mx.np.ndarray` in Numpy Extensions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New infertype and compute functions\r\n- [x] Additional checks for

Description ##\r\nThis PR serves to implement the remaining operators from the nn_activation category in opperf. To achieve this, I refactored the preexisting individual `run_performance_test` calls (for the four operators that had already been implemented) into a single generalized function call to `run_op_benchmarks`. I also implemented Softmax, SoftmaxActivation, softmin, and Activation ops, which are also called via the `run_op_benchmarks` function.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/nd_operations/nn_activation_operators.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/rules/default_params.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/op_registry_utils.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on c5.18xl & p2.16xl w/ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS with:\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nAdd settings to `config/config.cmake` to optimize for local CPU architecture.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Add -march=native -mtune=native to config/config.cmake\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nRelated https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17047\r\n\r\n@TaoLv would providing different default `config/config.cmake` files for different architectures with the respective compiler flags be an easier way forward than adding flags like `USE_X86_ARCH` to the `CMakeLists.txt`. What do you think?\r\n\r\nFor example, for ARM, the config file would instead contain \r\n```\r\n# CPU Architecture to optimize for. With default settings, your build may not\r\n# work on earlier CPUs than the one used by the system you are compiling on.\r\n# To work with older CPU, set the -march, -mtune variables below to the\r\n# respective architecture name of the target CPU (see GCC documentation).\r\nset(CMAKE_C_FLAGS \"-mcpu=native\" CACHE STRING \"C compiler flags\")\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \"-mcpu=native\" CACHE STRING \"C++ compiler flags\")\r\n```\r\nas per https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17047#issuecomment-565274798,

Description ##\r\nThis is the implementation for proposal https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17269\r\n\r\nThe coverage for dataset types are still limited but minimal examples are already available.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet.gluon.data.dataloader import no_mx_iter, DataLoader\r\nfrom mxnet.gluon.data.vision.transforms import ToTensor\r\n\r\ndataset = mx.gluon.data.vision.CIFAR10()\r\ncpp_dl = DataLoader(dataset.transform_first(ToTensor()), batch_size=32, num_workers=8)\r\nstart = time.time()\r\nfor _ in range(5):\r\n  print(len(cpp_dl))\r\n  for _ in cpp_dl:\r\n    pass\r\nprint('Elapsed time for backend dataloader:', time.time() - start)\r\n\r\nwith no_mx_iter:\r\n  dl =

free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nCompletely reworked this PR to establish compatibility with the current master. In the weeks since this PR was originally created, over 100 ops have been added to OpPerf, so I added functionality for testing each one with large tensor (dimension >= 2**32) data while ensuring that the suite still worked properly on standard data.\r\n\r\nI tested my changes extensively, merging my remaining PRs into this branch during testing to ensure that the full test suite worked with int64 tensor data on every op once all my kernel-level fixes were included.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a flag (`int64-tensor`) and relevant default data to OpPerf for every supported op, thereby allowing users to run the entire suite of opperf tests with int64 tensor data after they build MXNet with int64 tensor support.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the full suite takes an extremely long time (over one day) to run to completion on a machine with 748 GB of RAM, even with `warmup=1` and `runs=1`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x]

Changes ###\r\n- [x] modified:   src/operator/optimizer_op-inl.h\r\n- [x] modified:   src/operator/tensor/elemwise_unary_op.h\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested hard_sigmoid with LT input : Pass\r\n```\r\n>>> import mxnet as mx\r\n>>> mx.nd.hard_sigmoid(data=mx.nd.random_normal(shape=(1, 2**32 + 1))) [[0.9424413 0.6548008 0.7086881 ... 0.53579605 0.37985992 0.20645571]] \r\n<NDArray 1x4294967297 @cpu(0)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRest of the *_update functions can't be tested with random_normal inputs as they give NaNs as result (even for shape < 2**32)\r\nHence not tested. But they don't give a segmentation fault (which previously was the problem due to lack of Large tensor support).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-27T06:43:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T19:23:40Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T19:23:39Z","merged_at":"2020-02-10T19:23:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"b65db3cb3e46f5d0307b98a16bfa3ea5cbd07580","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nimplement exponential backward\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-22T03:26:19Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T20:09:43Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T20:09:43Z","merged_at":"2020-02-10T20:09:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"9aa5088d5bd119e19b49709df2f4611074c13cc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/968aecaded8af3f3d72f68f99b10886e4f05b07a","head":{"label":"Yiyan66:exponential_backward","ref":"exponential_backward","sha":"968aecaded8af3f3d72f68f99b10886e4f05b07a","user":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":221351337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjEzNTEzMzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nRefactor optimizers for MxNet 2.0:\r\n\r\nMain change: \r\n1. Base class `Optimizer` and `Updater` are split into two files.\r\n2. Each optimizer has its own file. \r\n3. To improve readability, each optimizer has two functions: `step` and `fused_step`. Pure ndarray implementation is put in function `step` while `fused_step` contains using optimized kernel. Using `step` or `fused_step` is controlled by flag `use_fused_step`. The main reason to have two step functions is that it is hard for an optimization researcher to implement a new optimizer if he refers to the existing implementations such as SGD. In PyTorch, they only use pure python code in `optim`. So I consider providing two update functions to maintain both readability and efficiency.\r\n4. `update`, `update_multi_precision`, `step`, and `fused_step` take as input `indices, weights, grads, states`, where the length of the list is determined by `aggregate_num`. When `aggregate_num = numpy.inf`, all the parameters are aggregated. This change is necessary if we want to implement some complex optimizers such as LBFGS and Barzilai-Borwein step size, which require access to all the parameters in a single function.\r\n5. Fix weight decay inconsistency #9881. Now, it is consistent with PyTorch and Tensorflow.\r\n6. Clean C++ implementation so that it is consistent with Python code. It is found that a small difference in implementation can lead to a precision difference of 1e-3. \r\n7. Discard `ccSGD` and `LBSGD`. `LBSGD` is simply `SGD` + `linear scaling` + `grad accumulation`, which shouldn't be an optimizer in optimizer API. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease

Description ##\r\nAdd operator sort\r\nMore compatible with numpy\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-21T08:51:11Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T07:43:06Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T07:43:06Z","merged_at":"2020-02-10T07:43:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae145cdb1de95e8275dd087585f4aab69bc94005","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/738260e0d2f7fb07968eccf54bdced28d52e5ad8","head":{"label":"hanke580:sort","ref":"sort","sha":"738260e0d2f7fb07968eccf54bdced28d52e5ad8","user":{"login":"hanke580","id":38852697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODUyNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38852697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580","html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225536280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjU1MzYyODA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hanke580/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanke580","id":38852697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODUyNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38852697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580","html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nChange the init value for All and ANY to make it consistent with official numpy.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-21T08:26:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T06:00:38Z","closed_at":"2020-01-23T06:00:38Z","merged_at":"2020-01-23T06:00:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"c81f2fe93651ef7dac575badba63cecdf1f6a3c4","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6f69d4673ec9fe7e8ae6d4ade632c634721dc535","head":{"label":"Tommliu:fix_any/all","ref":"fix_any/all","sha":"6f69d4673ec9fe7e8ae6d4ade632c634721dc535","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
