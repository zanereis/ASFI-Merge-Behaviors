PR moves the helper function checking nnvm operations against numpy reference implementations from `test_top_level#` to `nnvm.testing` and adds the ability to compare symbolic gradients to numerically computed gradients. Also this PR fixes a wrong gradient implementation for the division operation (it was found using this approach).\r\n\r\nCurrently only tests that used the old helper function are rewritten in such a way that they now use the new function. There are still many tests which didn't use the helper function, they should also be rewritten so that they use this function, if possible, but this is left for future work.","created_at":"2018-07-29T19:31:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T23:50:10Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T23:49:36Z","merged_at":"2018-08-23T23:49:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"0edf87e8548c9e96aa82278afdb6cca93f33cad6","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

and #1426 raise the issue of a performance regression introduced in #1387, due to a change in the Activity/Service Layout of the app.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the RPC App used a single process, and a single Activity for the entire app, comprising both the RPC Server and UI.\r\n#1387 moved the RPC Server to an Android Service in an isolated process, and added a watchdog to the main Activity. Unfortunately, processes running Services in Android are treated as lower priority than processes running Activities, so this caused a CPU performance regression in Android RPC.\r\n\r\nWe investigated reversing the layout to run the watchdog in a ForegroundService and instead run the RPC server in an Activity, but keeping the (watchdog) Service alive when the RPC server's Activity and process crash proved to be difficult and unreliable. We now choose to run the RPC server in a separate _Activity_ isolated from the main Activity's process. This way, if the RPC server crashes, it takes its Activity down by itself and resumes the main Activity of the app, which can trigger a restart of the RPC server. Using a separate _Activity_ also addresses the CPU performance regression issue. (ForegroundServices also complicated handling API levels >= 26 vs. < 26, which we are now happy to avoid).\r\n\r\nThe watchdog implementation has also been tweaked to use `notify` and `wait` instead of a polling mechanism, which should minimize any additional CPU overhead (though we believe the regression was due to using a Service).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the introduction of the RPC Tracker in #1080 duplicates much of the functionality of the RPC Proxy that the Android RPC app was originally designed to use. We now switch the Android RPC app to use the RPC Tracker protocol.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with a few UI changes to the Android app:\r\n+ Address now corresponds to the address of the RPC Tracker\r\n+ Port now corresponds to the port of the RPC Tracker\r\n+ Key now corresponds to the device key reported to the RPC Tracker\r\n+ The switch now controls whether the RPC server should automatically restart if crashed/closed\r\n+ The RPC server is now started with a button that launches a new Activity\r\n+ The new Activity has a button to stop the RPC server (note that if the switch is `ON`, the RPC server will restart itself)\r\n\r\nCC @alex-weaver @merrymercy

conda packages were in bad shape and some of them stopped working (in part due to the merging of tvm and nnvm).\r\n\r\nI spent a bit of time cleaning up and modernizing the build. The packages should build without issues on mac and linux (although you need a bit of special setup on mac because the conda compiler packages require that).\r\n\r\nOn major change is that the package no longer build with cuda enabled, but that can be fixed later.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be helpful to keep them working in the future would be to make the conda build a part of the CI pipeline,

two main changes required for this to work are:\r\n- armeabi is removed from the list of build targets, because it is deprecated in NDK r16, removed in NDK r17 and does not support vulkan. armeabi-v7a is of course still included.\r\n- vulkan non-dispatchable handles should use `VK_NULL_HANDLE` instead of `nullptr`, because on 32-bit build targets (such as armeabi-v7a) the handles are defined as `uint64_t` instead of a pointer type, so attempting to assign `nullptr` causes a compile error.\r\n\r\nApart from that, this PR just adds a `USE_VULKAN` option to the android RPC app's config.mk, and sets `TVM_VULKAN_RUNTIME=1` for `tvm_runtime.h`, similar to how OpenCL is handled.\r\n\r\nSide note: For some reason the performance of a brief test I ran was not great, the same model built against llvm and vulkan performed about 50% worse on vulkan. Also the CPU performance on Android seems to have suffered a significant regression at some point in the last 2 weeks or so.","created_at":"2018-07-12T17:50:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T07:23:07Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T21:44:35Z","merged_at":"2018-07-12T21:44:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8739309be62d20ead3aeb859872eb8af8adc92b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:
