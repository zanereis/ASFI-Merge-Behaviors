What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nchange `mv $f \"$DISTDIR\"/hive-jackson/` to `mv \"$f\" \"$DISTDIR\"/hive-jackson/`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAlways quote variables in shell scripts, especially when their content is unpredictable or when they are meant to represent file paths or names that could contain special characters. Quoting makes scripts more robust and prevents unexpected behavior caused by unusual filenames or input data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe can already select the desired overhead memory directly via the `spark.driver/executor.memoryOverhead` flags, however, if that flag is not present the overhead memory calculation goes as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\noverhead_memory = Max(384, 'spark.driver/executor.memory' * 'spark.driver/executor.memoryOverheadFactor')\r\n\r\n[where the 'memoryOverheadFactor' flag defaults to 0.1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new spark configs: `spark.driver.minMemoryOverhead` and `spark.executor.minMemoryOverhead`, which can be used to override the 384Mib minimum value.\r\n\r\nThe memory overhead calculation will now be :\r\n\r\n```\r\nmin_memory = sparkConf.get('spark.driver/executor.minMemoryOverhead') // has default of 384\r\n\r\noverhead_memory = Max(min_memory, 'spark.driver/executor.memory' * 'spark.driver/executor.memoryOverheadFactor')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are certain times where being able to override the 384Mb minimum directly can be beneficial. We may have a scenario where a lot of off-heap operations are performed (ex: using package managers/native compression/decompression) where we don't have a need for a large JVM heap but we may still need a signficant amount of memory in the spark node. \r\n\r\nUsing the `memoryOverheadFactor` config flag may not prove appropriate, since we may not want the overhead allocation to directly scale with JVM memory, as a cost saving/resource limitation problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, as described above, two new flags have been added to the spark config. No break of existing behaviours.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests for 3 cases:\r\n- If `spark.driver/executor.memoryOverhead` is set, then the new changes have no effect.\r\n- If  `spark.driver/executor.minMemoryOverhead` is set and its value is higher than  'spark.driver/executor.memory' * 'spark.driver/executor.memoryOverheadFactor', the total memory will be the allocated JVM memory + `spark.driver/executor.minMemoryOverhead`\r\n- If  `spark.driver/executor.minMemoryOverhead` but its value is lower than 'spark.driver/executor.memory' * 'spark.driver/executor.memoryOverheadFactor', the total memory will be the allocated JVM memory + 'spark.driver/executor.memory' * 'spark.driver/executor.memoryOverheadFactor'.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to provide `Apache Hive`'s `CodeHaus Jackson` dependencies via a new optional directory, `hive-jackson`, instead of the standard `jars` directory of Apache Spark binary distribution. Additionally, two internal configurations are added whose default values are `hive-jackson/*`.\r\n\r\n  - `spark.driver.defaultExtraClassPath`\r\n  - `spark.executor.defaultExtraClassPath`\r\n\r\nFor example, Apache Spark distributions have been providing `spark-*-yarn-shuffle.jar` file under `yarn` directory instead of `jars`.\r\n\r\n**YARN SHUFFLE EXAMPLE**\r\n```\r\n$ ls -al yarn/*jar\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 dongjoon  staff  77352048 Sep  8 19:08 yarn/spark-3.5.0-yarn-shuffle.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `Apache Hive`'s `CodeHaus Jackson` dependencies in a similar way.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ ls -al jars/*asl*\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 dongjoon  staff  232248 Sep  8 19:08 jars/jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 dongjoon  staff  780664 Sep  8 19:08 jars/jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ ls -al jars/*asl*\r\nzsh: no matches found: jars/*asl*\r\n\r\n$ ls -al hive-jackson\r\ntotal 1984\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 dongjoon  staff     128 Feb 23 15:37 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  16 dongjoon  staff     512 Feb 23 16:34 ..\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff  232248 Feb 23 15:37 jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff  780664 Feb 23 15:37 jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Hadoop 3.3.5, only Apache Hive requires old CodeHaus Jackson dependencies.\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.5.0 tried to eliminate them completely but it's reverted due to Hive UDF support.\r\n\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40893\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42446\r\n\r\nSPARK-47119 added a way to exclude Apache Hive Jackson dependencies at the distribution building stage for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n  - #45201\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a way to exclude Apache Hive Jackson dependencies at runtime for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n- Spark Shell without Apache Hive Jackson dependencies. \r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --driver-default-class-path \"\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\n- Spark SQL Shell without Apache Hive Jackson dependencies. \r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-sql --driver-default-class-path \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spark Thrift Server without Apache Hive Jackson dependencies. \r\n```\r\n$ sbin/start-thriftserver.sh --driver-default-class-path \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, last but not least, this PR eliminates `CodeHaus Jackson` dependencies from the following Apache Spark deamons (using `spark-daemon.sh start`) because they don't require Hive `CodeHaus Jackson` dependencies \r\n\r\n- Spark Master\r\n- Spark Worker\r\n- Spark History Server\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep 'spark-daemon.sh start' *\r\nstart-history-server.sh:exec \"${SPARK_HOME}/sbin\"/spark-daemon.sh start $CLASS 1 \"$@\"\r\nstart-master.sh:\"${SPARK_HOME}/sbin\"/spark-daemon.sh start $CLASS 1 \\\r\nstart-worker.sh:  \"${SPARK_HOME}/sbin\"/spark-daemon.sh start $CLASS $WORKER_NUM \\\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. There is no user-facing change by default.\r\n\r\n- For the distributions with `hive-jackson-provided` profile, the `scope` of Apache Hive Jackson dependencies is `provided` and `hive-jackson` directory is not created at all.\r\n- For the distributions with default setting, the `scope` of Apache Hive Jackson dependencies is still `compile`. In addition, they are in the Apache Spark's built-in class path like the following.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-23 at 16 48

Worker\r\n  - Spark History Server\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and manually build a distribution and check the class paths in the `Environment` Tab.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dev/make-distribution.sh -Phive,hive-thriftserver\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

This causes unnecessary stage materialization by submitting Shuffle Job and Broadcast Job. Under normal circumstances, if the stage is already non-materialized (a.k.a `ShuffleQueryStage.shuffleFuture` or `BroadcastQueryStage.broadcastFuture` is not initialized yet), it should just be skipped without materializing it.\r\n\r\n**Problematic Stacktrace:**\r\n```\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.ShuffleExchangeExec.submitShuffleJob(ShuffleExchangeExec.scala:104)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.adaptive.ShuffleQueryStageExec.shuffleFuture$lzycompute(QueryStageExec.scala:210)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.adaptive.ShuffleQueryStageExec.shuffleFuture(QueryStageExec.scala:210)\r\nat

org.apache.spark.sql.execution.adaptive.AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.$anonfun$cleanUpAndThrowException$1(AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala:905)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease find sample use-case:\r\n**1- Stage Materialization Steps:**\r\nWhen stage materialization is failed:\r\n```\r\n1.1- ShuffleQueryStage1 - is materialized successfully,\r\n1.2- ShuffleQueryStage2 - materialization is failed,\r\n1.3- ShuffleQueryStage3 - Not materialized yet so ShuffleQueryStage3.shuffleFuture is not initialized yet\r\n```\r\n**2- Stage Cancellation Steps:**\r\n```\r\n2.1- ShuffleQueryStage1 - is canceled due to already materialized,\r\n2.2- ShuffleQueryStage2 - is earlyFailedStage so currently, it is skipped as default by AQE because it could not be materialized,\r\n2.3- ShuffleQueryStage3 - Problem is here: This stage is not materialized yet but currently, it is also tried to cancel and this stage requires to be materialized first.\r\n```\r\n**Reproduce Steps:**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45234/files#diff-f89f2fe78b324c6bc7190bef84220181f3616efc156ea99b3f15d375a22d7f88R900\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent logic introduces unnecessary Shuffle Job / Broadcast Job to be able to cancel `ShuffleQueryStage` / `BroadcastQueryStage`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new Unit Tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCollated expression `SELECT 'abc' COLLATE 'UCS_BASIC_LCASE'` is failing when connecting to sever using Spark Connect (in this case with pyspark):\r\n```\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectGrpcException: (org.apache.spark.sql.connect.common.InvalidPlanInput) Does not support convert string(UCS_BASIC_LCASE) to connect proto types.\r\n```\r\nWhen using default collation `UCS_BASIC`, the error is not occurring.\r\n\r\nFix the error by making `StringType` protobuf compliant with Spark datatype which now includes collation id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix the error which collations introduce in Spark connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, when previously running\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --remote 'sc://localhost'\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"SELECT 'abc' COLLATE 'UCS_BASIC_LCASE'\")\r\n...\r\n```\r\nthe described error would appear. These changes remove the error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChanges include test which simulates described behavior by utilizing `SparkConnectServerTest` to establish client-server connection. Test is invoked by `build/sbt 'connect/testOnly *SparkConnectServiceE2ESuite'`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport stage-level scheduling for PySpark connect DataFrame APIs (mapInPandas and mapInArrow).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44852 has supported ResourceProfile in mapInPandas/mapInArrow for SQL, So it's the right time to enable it for connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, Users can pass ResourceProfile to mapInPandas/mapInArrow through the connect pyspark client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere seems to be a regression from Spark 2.4 as the following code no longer succeed:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = df.select(df(\"a\").as(\"aa\"), df(\"b\").as(\"bb\"))\r\nval df3 = df2.join(df, df2(\"bb\") === df(\"b\")).select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))\r\ndf3.show()\r\n```\r\nThis is because Spark 3+ deduplicates relations aggressively:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.DeduplicateRelations ===\r\n!'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#8)              'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#18)\r\n :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]    :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]\r\n :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]   :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]\r\n :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]        :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n!+- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]      +- Project [_1#15 AS a#17, _2#16 AS b#18]\r\n!   +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]              +- LocalRelation [_1#15, _2#16]\r\n```\r\nand so Spark 3 thinks `df(\"a\")` is ambigous:\r\n`Column a#7 are ambiguous. It's probably because you joined several Datasets together, and some of these Datasets are the same. This column points to one of the Datasets but Spark is unable to figure out which one. Please alias the Datasets with different names via `Dataset.as` before joining them, and specify the column using qualified name, e.g. df.as(\"a\").join(df.as(\"b\"), $\"a.id\" > $\"b.id\"). You can also set spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin to false to disable this check.`\r\n\r\nIf we disable `spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin` then the real issue reveals: Due to the aggressive deduplication the last `.select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))` doesn't work any more.\r\n```\r\n[MISSING_ATTRIBUTES.RESOLVED_ATTRIBUTE_APPEAR_IN_OPERATION] Resolved attribute(s) \"a\" missing from \"aa\", \"bb\", \"a\", \"b\" in operator !Project [aa#11, a#7]. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: \"a\".\r\nPlease check if the right attribute(s) are used. SQLSTATE: XX000;\r\n!Project [aa#11, a#7]\r\n+- Join Inner, (bb#12 = b#18)\r\n   :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]\r\n   :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n   +- Project [_1#15 AS a#17, _2#16 AS b#18]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [_1#15, _2#16]\r\n```\r\nIn this PR I am trying to use a less aggressive deduplication as there is a `Project` node above the inner `LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]` explicitely added by the user which makes the plan clear an unambiguous.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately certain rules like `RewritePredicateSubquery` require aggresive deduplication.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `ArtifactSuite` to use unique `MavenCoordinate`s.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`MavenCoordinate(\"my.great.lib\", \"mylib\", \"0.1\")` is used in many places. However, `ArtifactSuite` uses it differently to check transitive dependencies. Sometimes, the other suites' leftover causes a test case failure. We had better use unique artifact name in this case in order to isolate completely.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep 'MavenCoordinate(\"my.great.lib\", \"mylib\",

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR exposes a config allowing user to migrate the shuffle data directly to external storage. Changes are made to migrate the data in multiple thread to reduce the migration time. Similarly, the reading of shuffle data from external storage is done using multiple thread. Configuration parameter is added to control the number of threads to be used for reading shuffle data.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark supports migration of shuffle data to peer nodes during node decommissioning. If peer nodes are not accessible, then Spark falls back to external storage. User needs to provide the storage location path. There are scenarios where user may want to migrate to external storage instead of peer nodes. This may be because of unstable nodes or due to the need of aggressive scale down. So, user should be able to configure to migrate the shuffle data directly to external storage if the use case permits. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now user can enable migrating shuffle data directly to external storage and also control the number of threads used for reading shuffle data from external storage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew Unit tests are added.\r\nMade sure that existing tests are passing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

This new abstraction enhances modularity and facilitates more flexible management of file listings within the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of these constructs is crucial for defining a standardized API for file listing operations,  regardless of the underlying representation that's used to represent files and partitions. By improving the modularity of the code we enable future improvements that can prove to be beneficial both for runtime and memory improvements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is just a refactoring, not a new behavior, so existing tests would suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-02-22T23:00:33Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T00:16:22Z","closed_at":"2024-02-26T00:16:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e74101be546ed2f7480bed1b8de381e84e92eb25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f4e5b21747ff95d261ac847dbee16088c0cb2ad","head":{"label":"costas-db:refactorFileListing","ref":"refactorFileListing","sha":"0f4e5b21747ff95d261ac847dbee16088c0cb2ad","user":{"login":"costas-db","id":115515316,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuKftA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115515316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db","html_url":"https://github.com/costas-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":761531840,"node_id":"R_kgDOLWQNwA","name":"spark","full_name":"costas-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"costas-db","id":115515316,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuKftA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115515316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db","html_url":"https://github.com/costas-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costas-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/costas-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the kafka connector code, we have several code that throws the java **IllegalStateException** to report data loss, while reading from Kafka. This change is to properly classify those exceptions using the new error framework. Adds a new exception type `SparkIllegalStateException` that can receive error class. New error classes are introduced for Kafka data loss errors. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNew error framework for better error messages\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, better error message with error class\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existing tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-22T22:19:39Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T00:26:56Z","closed_at":"2024-02-29T00:26:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c18753e3d0f17ccf07004643a68b49a94011cf40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims the following.\r\n1. Fix `MavenUtilsSuite` to use `MavenUtils.resolveMavenCoordinates` properly by using `ivyPath` parameter of `MavenUtils.loadIvySettings` method consistently.\r\n2. Make all test cases isolated by adding `beforeEach` and `afterEach` instead of a single `beforeAll`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. `MavenUtils` assumes to set the following together inside if it receives `ivyPath`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9debaeaa5a079a73605cddb90b1a77274c5284d3/common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/MavenUtils.scala#L337-L342\r\n\r\n3. `MavenUtilsSuite` uses `tempIvyPath` for all `MavenUtils.resolveMavenCoordinates` except one test case.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9debaeaa5a079a73605cddb90b1a77274c5284d3/common/utils/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/MavenUtilsSuite.scala#L175-L175\r\n\r\n4. The following is the missed case and this PR aims to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds `COLLATION_ENABLED` config to `SQLConf` and introduces new error class `COLLATION_SUPPORT_NOT_ENABLED` to appropriately report error on usage of feature under development. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to make collations configurable on this flag. These changes disable usage of `collate` and `collation` functions, along with any `COLLATE` syntax when the flag is set to false. By default, the flag is set to false.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It introduces new error along with an appropriate message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryCompilationErrorsSuite test\r\n./build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CollationExpressionSuite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the default value of `spark.sql.hive.metastore.sharedPrefixes` configuration by enumerating the following JDBC prefixes.\r\n\r\n- `com.ibm.db2` (Added, SPARK-31272)\r\n- `com.microsoft.sqlserver` (Unchanged)\r\n- `com.mysql.jdbc` (Unchanged)\r\n- `oracle.jdbc` (Unchanged)\r\n- `org.mariadb.jdbc` (Added, SPARK-31021)\r\n- `org.postgresql` (Unchanged)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Apache Spark maintains the test coverage of RDBMSes, some prefixes are missed.\r\n\r\nFor example, the latest `MariaDB` and `IBM` drivers are missing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

needed?\r\n\r\nIt still fails https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7994847558.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to prevent `null` for `tokenizer.getContext`. This is similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28029. `getContext` seemingly via the univocity library, it can return null if `begingParsing` is not invoked (https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/blob/master/src/main/java/com/univocity/parsers/common/AbstractParser.java#L53). This can happen when `parseLine` is not invoked at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e081f06ea401a2b6b8c214a36126583d35eaf55f/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/csv/UnivocityParser.scala#L300 - `parseLine` invokes `begingParsing`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix up a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. In a very rare case, when `CsvToStructs` is used as a sole predicate against an empty row, it might trigger NPE. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, but test case will be done in a separate PR. We should backport this to all branches.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-22T00:17:58Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T03:13:44Z","closed_at":"2024-02-22T03:13:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"693f8227fa3878e2606d97d4d1a727c95e7d16f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e0ae5c9c4bd1e85ee8c111ae23c29e70c96d919","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-47125","ref":"SPARK-47125","sha":"7e0ae5c9c4bd1e85ee8c111ae23c29e70c96d919","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change cleans up any dangling files tracked as being previously uploaded if they were cleaned up from the filesystem. The cleaning can happen due to a compaction racing in parallel with commit, where compaction completes after commit and a older version is loaded on the same executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe changes are needed to prevent RocksDB versionId mismatch errors (which require users to clean the checkpoint directory and retry the query). \r\n\r\nA particular scenario where this can happen is provided below: \r\n\r\n1. Version V1 is loaded on executor A, RocksDB State Store has 195.sst, 196.sst, 197.sst and 198.sst files. \r\n2. State changes are made, which result in creation of a new table file 200.sst. \r\n3. State store is committed as version V2. The SST file 200.sst (as 000200-8c80161a-bc23-4e3b-b175-cffe38e427c7.sst) is uploaded to DFS, and previous 4 files are reused. A new metadata file is created to track the exact SST files with unique IDs, and uploaded with RocksDB Manifest as part of V1.zip.\r\n4. Rocks DB compaction is triggered at the same time. The compaction creates a new L1 file (201.sst), and deletes existing 5 SST files.\r\n5. Spark Stage is retried. \r\n6. Version V1 is reloaded on the same executor. The local files are inspected, and 201.sst is deleted. The 4 SST files in version V1 are downloaded again to local file system. \r\n7. Any local files which are deleted (as part of version load) are also removed from local → DFS file upload tracking. **However, the files already deleted as a result of compaction are not removed from tracking. This is the bug which resulted in the failure.**\r\n8. State store is committed as version V1. However, the local mapping of SST files to DFS file path still has 200.sst in its tracking, hence the SST file is not re-uploaded. A new metadata file is created to track the exact SST files with unique IDs, and uploaded with the new RocksDB Manifest as part of V2.zip. (The V2.zip file is overwritten here atomically)\r\n9. A new executor tried to load version V2. However, the SST files in (1) are now incompatible with Manifest file in (6) resulting in the version Id mismatch failure. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test cases to cover the scenario where some files were deleted on the file system.\r\n\r\nThe test case fails with the existing master with error `Mismatch in unique ID on table file 16`, and is successful with changes in this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to avoid uncaught `RejectedExecutionException`s while `StandaloneSchedulerBackend` is shutting down.\r\n\r\nWhen the backend is shut down, its `stop()` method calls `executorDelayRemoveThread.shutdownNow()`. After this point, though, it's possible that its `StandaloneDriverEndpoint` might still process `onDisconnected` events and those might trigger calls to schedule new tasks on the `executorDelayRemoveThread`. This causes uncaught `java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException`s to be thrown in RPC threads.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a `try-catch` to catch those exceptions and log a short warning if the exceptions occur while the scheduler is stopping. This approach is consistent with other similar code in Spark, including:\r\n\r\n-

needed?\r\n\r\nRemove log and exception noise.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo new tests: it is difficult to reliably reproduce the scenario that leads to the log noise.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-21T20:06:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T21:35:55Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T21:35:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7784dfb823267257f147d9940d2eb31570fe39d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d85a951a7b9934c8645b301278172ea2ea8bed72","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:reduce-scheduler-backend-shutdown-noise","ref":"reduce-scheduler-backend-shutdown-noise","sha":"d85a951a7b9934c8645b301278172ea2ea8bed72","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to provide a new profile, `hive-jackson-provided`, for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Hadoop 3.3.5, only Apache Hive requires old CodeHaus Jackson dependencies.\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.5.0 tried to eliminate them completely but it's reverted due to Hive UDF support.\r\n- #40893\r\n- #42446\r\n\r\nTo allow Apache Spark 4.0 users\r\n- To provide their own CodeHaus Jackson libraries \r\n- To exclude them completely if they don't use `Hive UDF`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a new profile.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and manual build.\r\n\r\n**Without `hive-jackson-provided`**\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec#executeCollect` and `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec#doExecute` to initialize the unsafe projection before using it to produce output rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause the unsafe projection is not initialized, non-deterministic expressions also don't get initialized. This results in errors when the projection contains non-deterministic expressions. For example:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1(id, name) as values\r\n(1, \"fred\"),\r\n(2, \"bob\");\r\n\r\ncache table v1;\r\n\r\nselect name, uuid() as _iid from (\r\n  select * from v1 order by name\r\n)\r\nlimit 20;\r\n```\r\nThis query produces the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.RandomUUIDGenerator.getNextUUIDUTF8String()\" because \"this.randomGen_0\" is null\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.TakeOrderedAndProjectExec.$anonfun$executeCollect$6(limit.scala:297)\r\n\tat scala.collection.ArrayOps$.map$extension(ArrayOps.scala:934)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.TakeOrderedAndProjectExec.$anonfun$executeCollect$1(limit.scala:297)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-21T18:25:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:40:34Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T20:53:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53d16d862711362d04ccad9ad065700276320946","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea19a5affb4e85557f9195f07d4f274ed1fa5a6a","head":{"label":"bersprockets:take_ordered_issue","ref":"take_ordered_issue","sha":"ea19a5affb4e85557f9195f07d4f274ed1fa5a6a","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange description of `returns` in docstring for pyspark's dataframe's `head` to match actual behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe docstring claimed that `head(n)` would return a `Row` (rather than a list of rows) iff n == 1, but that's incorrect.\r\n\r\nType hints, example, and implementation show that the difference between row or list of rows lies in whether n is supplied at all -- if it isn't, `head()` returns a `Row`, if it is, even if it is 1, `head(n)` returns a list.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, only a Python docstring is changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo tests were added since only docs changed.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-21T13:08:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T19:14:51Z","closed_at":"2024-02-22T19:14:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59d48e3e824e11f9b730e19d7c9e8f13bc98a4cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0061762d62efa2169bde6fee1168d5602d04b2da","head":{"label":"wunderalbert:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"0061762d62efa2169bde6fee1168d5602d04b2da","user":{"login":"wunderalbert","id":55346556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzQ2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55346556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert","html_url":"https://github.com/wunderalbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":761210936,"node_id":"R_kgDOLV8oOA","name":"spark","full_name":"wunderalbert/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wunderalbert","id":55346556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzQ2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55346556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert","html_url":"https://github.com/wunderalbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wunderalbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wunderalbert/spark","description":"Apache

However, it shows warnings when the Python version is too low during the attempt to look up Python Data Sources for session initialization. The Windows 2019 runner includes Python 3.7, which Spark does not support. Therefore, we simply install the proper Python for simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRevert [SPARK-35878][CORE] Add fs.s3a.endpoint if unset and fs.s3a.endpoint.region is null\r\n\r\nRemoving the region/endpoint patching code of SPARK-35878 avoids authentication problems with versions of the S3A connector built with AWS v2 SDK -as is the case in Hadoop 3.4.0.\r\n\r\nThat is: if fs.s3a.endpoint is unset it will stay unset.\r\n\r\nThe v2 SDK does its binding to AWS Services differently, in what can be described as \"region first\" binding. Spark setting the endpoint blocks S3 Express support and is incompatible with HADOOP-18975 S3A: Add option fs.s3a.endpoint.fips to use AWS FIPS endpoints\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6277\r\n\r\nThe change is compatible with all releases of the s3a connector other than hadoop 3.3.1 binaries deployed outside EC2 and without the endpoint explicitly set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAWS v2 SDK has a different/complex binding mechanism; it doesn't need the endpoint to\r\nbe set if the region (fs.s3a.region) value is set. This means the spark code to\r\nfix an endpoint is not only un-needed, it causes problems when trying to use specific\r\nstorage options (S3 Express) or security options (FIPS)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOnly visible on hadoop 3.3.1 s3a connector when deployed outside of EC2 -the situation the original patch was added to work around. All other 3.3.x releases are good.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRemoved some obsolete tests. Relying on github and jenkins to do the testing so marking this PR as WiP until they are happy.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

changes were proposed in this pull request? On the lines of DPP which helps DataSourceV2 relations when the joining key is a partition column, the same concept can be extended over to the case where joining key is not a partition column. In this PR, the keys available in the BroadcastHashJoinExec are pushed down to the DataSourceV2 scans in form of a SortedSet structure. For non partition columns, the DataSources like iceberg have max/min stats on columns available at manifest level, and for formats like parquet , they have max/min stats at various data structure levels. The passed SortedSet can be used to prune using ranges at both driver level ( manifests files) as well as executor level ( while actually going through chunks , row groups etc at parquet level)\r\nIf the data is stored as Columnar Batch format , then it would not be possible to filter out individual row at DataSource level, even though we have keys. But at the scan level, ( ColumnToRowExec) it is still possible to filter out as many rows as possible , if the query involves nested joins. Thus reducing the number of rows to join at the higher join levels.\r\nAttaching link to a presentation which outlines the idea: [Broadcast Keys pushdown](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/165Rx7i00TmAKnDJpSQLfrcrW-ShrzPy5/edit?usp=drive_link)\r\nSPIP : [SPIP-44662](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44662)\r\nWhy are the changes needed? There is scope of improvement in the performance of Inner and Left Semi join queries when using BroadcastHashJoin\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change? No\r\nHow was this patch tested? Ran TPCDS suite using iceberg as DataSource. Converted many of the existing Spark Query tests to also run using iceberg as data source. Will be adding more unit tests.","created_at":"2024-02-21T00:52:19Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T00:19:44Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T00:19:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7be1a4358535f904ca5f2bf1e65a3e0f7c00af21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf3952ee422fd874c1388762fcb9271234bc032b","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-44662","ref":"SPARK-44662","sha":"cf3952ee422fd874c1388762fcb9271234bc032b","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nOnly occurrence of `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1175` appears under conversion from Spark data types to Parquet. All supported documented [Spark data types](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html) are covered in the [conversion function](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3e0808c33f185c13808ce2d547ce9ba0057d31a6/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetSchemaConverter.scala#L517-L745) (`VarcharType` and `CharType` are not present but they are passed down as string before reaching the conversion function), so under normal circumstances user can't force this error.\r\n\r\nConvert the error class to `INTERNAL_ERROR`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRemove legacy error classes as part of activity in [SPARK-37935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37935).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIf the Spark works correctly, user shouldn't be able to run into `INTERNAL_ERROR` by using the public API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded test to `QueryCompilationErrorsSuite` and tested with sbt:\r\n```\r\nproject sql\r\ntestOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGenerally, the ML algorithms require multiple rounds of iterations, in the current implementation of MLlib(both `ml` and `mllib`), almost everywhere is hardcoded with `data.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)` except to ALS which allows set intermediate RDD storage level via API.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Sets storage level for intermediate RDDs (user/product in/out links). The default value is\r\n   * `MEMORY_AND_DISK`. Users can change it to a serialized storage, e.g., `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER` and\r\n   * set `spark.rdd.compress` to `true` to reduce the space requirement, at the cost of speed.\r\n   */\r\n  @Since(\"1.1.0\")\r\n  def setIntermediateRDDStorageLevel(storageLevel: StorageLevel): this.type = {\r\n    require(storageLevel != StorageLevel.NONE,\r\n      \"ALS is not designed to run without persisting intermediate RDDs.\")\r\n    this.intermediateRDDStorageLevel = storageLevel\r\n    this\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a configuration `spark.ml.defaultIntermediateStorageLevel` to make the default storage level of intermediate datasets for MLlib configurable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith storage level MEMORY_AND_DISK, once the executor that holds the RDD cached block is killed by the resource manager (e.g. OOM), the RDD cache becomes corrupt.\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-27677 (since 3.0), the External Shuffle Service could serve cached RDD block which persisted on the disk, so it would be helpful if we set the storage level of intermediate RDD to DISK.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. The default value of `spark.ml.defaultIntermediateStorageLevel` is MEMORY_AND_DISK to keep the original behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTest case checks the consistence of `cached.count()` and `cached.collect()`, and makes sure that size of collect is same as count. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

Any column name that is specified within backticks (`) is treated literally. Within a backtick string, use double backticks (``) to represent a backtick character. Backtick quotation also enables the use of reserved keywords for table and column identifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Hive Doc, the column names have the flexibility to contain any character from the Unicode set.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes HiveExternalCatalog.verifyDataSchema:\r\n\r\n- Allow comma to be used in top-level column names\r\n- remove check invalid characters in nested type definition for hard-coded \",:;\", which turns out to be incomplete. for example, \"^%\", etc., are not allowed. They are all delayed to Hive API calls instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to use `ordinalNumber` to `uniformly` set the value of `paramIndex` for the error class `UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen I was reviewing the spark code, I found that:\r\n- Some expressions may have a starting value of 1 when throwing error `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE`, eg:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b0aad59f123581b66515c864873f46ea4ec4e762/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/stringExpressions.scala#L300-L302\r\n\r\n- Some are 0, eg:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b0aad59f123581b66515c864873f46ea4ec4e762/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/bitmapExpressions.scala#L117-L119\r\n\r\n**We should `unify` it and avoid understanding differences.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the value of 'paramIndex' for the error class `UNEXPECTED-INPUT-TYPE` is uniformly set by `ordinalNumber`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Updated existed UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-20T03:36:14Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T20:29:19Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T18:33:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f669cf9132a664f6d142539c3f674e43297bca58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e820a798af2142aed0fa91293eb1b40da4c548ff","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-47099","ref":"SPARK-47099","sha":"e820a798af2142aed0fa91293eb1b40da4c548ff","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `TypedConfigBuilder` API by new method:\r\n```scala\r\n  def checkValue(\r\n      validator: T => Boolean,\r\n      errorClass: String,\r\n      parameters: Map[String, String]): TypedConfigBuilder[T] = {\r\n```\r\nwhich raises `SparkIllegalArgumentException` with an error class when `checkValue` fails.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I ported the check of the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone` on the new method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user's experience with Spark SQL by migration on unified error framework.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt can if user's code depends on particular format of error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLConfSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is an upgrade ticket to bump the Jetty version from 10 to 11, and the Jersey version from 2 to 3, so the project can gradually move away from Javax.servlet package and adopt the Jakrata standard, code changes on a high level involves:\r\n\r\n1.  Bump `jakarta.servlet-api` from 4 to 5 in order to adopt the new namespace.\r\n2. Re-introduce the `javax.servlet-api` and `jaxb-api` jars, as Hive-related Jars are using old servelet reference internally, or else it will throw classNotFound during test and runtime, also this makes us decouple the HIve upgrade from this MR.\r\n3. Rewrite the Tservlet class from LIbThrift with alternative namespace `Jakrata` instead of `Javax`, again this helps us to decouple the LIbThrift upgrade task from this MR, or else we will need to wait for Hive 4.  \r\n\r\n4. Update `MimaExclude.scala` to exclude the breaking compatibility that introduced by javax -> jakrata.\r\n\r\n5. Update Scalac option to prevent the enum scan on third-party jar `org.dmg.pmml` and its failed the build. \r\n\r\n6. Update ALL internal servlet implementation from Javax to Jakrata.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo the Spark one step closer to the latest version of Jetty and Jersey, to receive up-to-date security fixes.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI build & Unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-18T04:51:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T20:56:25Z","closed_at":"2024-02-23T20:08:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"008f3f07a5144aa42659c3114d940b09731c4482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
