there, this PR wants to introduce a new TIR schedule primitive `schd.decompose_padding(block, loop)`.\r\n\r\nFor padded `conv` or `pooling` ops, there is a typical padding pattern:\r\n\r\n`Pad[_] = T.if_then_else(pad_predicate, X[_], pad_value)` \r\n\r\nwhich could be decomposed into two parts:\r\n- One filling pad values with `memset` routine\r\n- One filling in-bound values with `memcpy` routine\r\n\r\nThe primitive's signature is alike `decompose_reduction`, which provides a target block and a loop position to insert newly created \"init\" block. It is helpful for infrastructures with high-performance memset/memcpy routines, and leverage the complexity to process padding conditions in the main compute block.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n- Before\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef before_decompose(x: T.Buffer[128, \"int32\"], y: T.Buffer[140, \"int32\"]):\r\n    for i in range(140):\r\n        with T.block(\"block\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.remap(\"S\", [i])\r\n            y[vi] = T.if_then_else(vi >= 6 and vi < 134, x[vi - 6], 0, dtype=\"int32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- After  `decompose_padding(block, i)`\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef after_decompose(x: T.Buffer[128, \"int32\"], y: T.Buffer[140, \"int32\"]):\r\n    for i in T.serial(140):\r\n        with T.block(\"block_pad_const\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(140, i)\r\n            y[vi] = 0\r\n    for i in T.serial(128):\r\n        with T.block(\"block\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(128, i)\r\n            y[vi + 6] = x[vi]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives and drawbacks\r\n- From the graph perspective, one may be able to totally fold out the block which pad the input buffer. While the primitive seems to be more useful when one wants to perform padding in the intra-primfunc buffers.\r\n\r\n- One could also `compute-inline` the block perform padding, this introduces conditions in the main computation block, which may or may-not get optimized well, depending on the concrete target.\r\n\r\n- Currently there are schedule ability limitations on created blocks after decomposition. They can not be then `compute-at`ed or `compute-inline`d. Because multiple blocks write to the same buffer break the stage pipeline property.","created_at":"2022-07-25T13:39:49Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T17:35:54Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T17:35:54Z","merged_at":"2022-07-27T17:35:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca30e5e2e4f89aa4cce318da7c333fa84a964d26","assignee":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ae7a62ec850ca72b1931046fd3b0feaab41592b6","head":{"label":"wrongtest-intellif:decompose_padding","ref":"decompose_padding","sha":"ae7a62ec850ca72b1931046fd3b0feaab41592b6","user":{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270636227,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA2MzYyMjc=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"wrongtest-intellif/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https:

for OpenCL runs was hanging because nested timer runs were not correctly handled. This is because each call to the `Timer::Start` function on OpenCL device causes the OpenCL event queue to be cleared.\r\n\r\nThe hang was due to the fact that the minimum run time was not reached for profiling, if it is set greater than zero. Since the queue is cleared every `Start` call, the time of only one run is returned, not `number`.\r\n\r\nIt happens in this cycle:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/75ec1cffa9f160dd3165fedbf4408731ebfa797a/src/runtime/profiling.cc#L876-L891\r\n\r\nHere `pf.CallPacked(args, &temp)` call function which contains one more call `Timer::Start` and `Timer::End`.\r\n\r\nAlso profiling was hanging for `__nop` functions like `reshape` due to there are no OpenCL calls for this node. So that OpenCL timer returns 0, which is less than the minimum time value.\r\n\r\nThe `__nop` functions are now skipped for profiling.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-25T13:31:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T19:18:10Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T19:18:10Z","merged_at":"2022-07-27T19:18:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"96b151751abcdbe98f4e79be1965158fb251d218","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9df998eff9a8ef12560200d65ca06f9276dab833","head":{"label":"Deelvin:opencl_profiling_fix","ref":"opencl_profiling_fix","sha":"9df998eff9a8ef12560200d65ca06f9276dab833","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open

`SplitString` now preserves escape sequences, but still observes quote characters.\r\n- Added function `Interpret` that transforms given string according to interpretation rules:\r\n  - outermost quotes are removed (if present),\r\n  - escape sequences inside quotes are preserved verbatim,\r\n  - unquoted escape sequences produce the escaped character (the escape character (\\\\) is removed.\r\n- Interpretation happens every time a value of any type is to be parsed from a string, e.g. Array<String> will first be parsed as an array, then substrings of the input will be parsed as individual elements of that array. In this case, some parts of the initial input will be parsed (and interpreted) twice.\r\n- Implement corresponding stringification functionality.\r\n\r\nThis new scheme enabled encoding nested arrays of string with any degree of nesting. For example\r\n```\r\n\"-field='\\\\'foo0\\\\',\\\\'bar0,bar1\\\\'','\\\\'zing0,zing1\\\\',\\\\'fred\\\\''\"\r\n```\r\nwould correspond to the target kind attribute\r\n```\r\nArray<Array<Array<String>>>(\"field\"))\r\n```\r\nand have the value\r\n```\r\n{ { {foo0}, {bar0, bar1} }, { {zing0, zing1}, {fred} }

implements RFC 80. See https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/83.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Created an `LLVMScope` class. Uses of LLVM functions and data structures should be contained within the lifetime of an object of this class. LLVMScope object contains LLVMContext, and implements member functions to deserialize an llvm::Module.\r\n- Created an `LLVMTarget` class. Once an LLVMScope object has been created, an object of LLVMTarget class can be created from TVM target string, or Target object for \"llvm\" target. Once LLVM command line flags are added to the \"llvm\" target, one of the goals of this object will be to save/restore relevant LLVM global state. Another objective for the LLVMTarget object is to be a single location for all LLVM-related compilation structures and options (such as TargetMachine, FastMathFlags, etc.)","created_at":"2022-07-19T22:05:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T23:17:55Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T23:16:48Z","merged_at":"2022-08-03T23:16:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e02cf7cbeb4129e0cb83c5c8574c44dce506679","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/27e5be7748b5d4735994a20cf287dc9d5e58c66b","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:llvm-scope-target","ref":"llvm-scope-target","sha":"27e5be7748b5d4735994a20cf287dc9d5e58c66b","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"85aa597245e6b437c4c1c712154f8d0b9eb73d43","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

the `flash` function would sometimes lock up indefinitely without failing, stalling for hours or more. This pull request changes it to have a 60-second timeout (more than enough time to upload a sketch), and adds the ability to retry the command if it fails.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also adds a unit test for this functionality, and also makes a few changes to `microtvm_api_server.py` to better comply with `pylint`. \n\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

Special thanks\r\nto Matthew Barrett for his help getting this over the line.\r\n\r\nThe only C++ functionality added here is for 'pruning' candidates. This is a somewhat\r\nspeculative algorithm (and I've called that out in the comments) which tries to\r\nelide candidate partitions which will 'obviously' not contribute to the final optimal\r\npartitioning. For largish models such as GPT2 this can significantly reduce the number of\r\ncandidates we need to actually measure latency on.

when two IR objects fail a structural equality check, currently there is no easy way to find out which part of the IR caused the mismatch. In this PR, we modify the `StructuralEqual` infrastructure to also optionally return a pair of `ObjectPath` objects that point to the mismatch. (See https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11977). In the upcoming PRs, we will pass these paths to the TIR printer, so that it could highlight the mismatch location nicely.\r\n\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/11912\r\n\r\ncc

Primitive=1 functions were not analyzed and calls to such were completely\r\nunconstrained. With this change at least any virtual device annotation on the function\r\nare respected and accounted for in calls, even though the body is not analyzed.\r\n\r\nWhile working on the unit test noticed it is possible to end up with two structurally equal\r\nvirtual devices which are not pointer equal even after canonicalization. Fix that by\r\nintroducing target canonicalization on the CompilationConfig.\r\n\r\nThis may help with piggy-backing on PlanDevices for doing memory scope analysis, since\r\nit is now possible to express cross-scope functions on Primitive functions. However\r\nI believe there are other issues to deal with in addition to this

Runs the above rules on the model to collect all the candidates.\r\n 3. Eliminates candidates whose target contradicts any constraints already\r\n    imposed by, eg, device planning.\r\n 4. Eagerly estimates the cost of each candidate.\r\n 5. Performs a shortest path search to chose an 'optimal' set of candidate \r\n    partitions so as to minimize estimated model latency, such that every sub-expression\r\n    node is contained in exactly one candidate partition.\r\n 6. Coalesces adjacent optimal candidates which ended up on the same target.\r\n 7. Rewrites the model according to the chosen optimal partitioning.\r\n\r\nAs for the existing partition_for_<external codegen name> methods, the result of\r\nCollagePartition can then be built using regular TVM.\r\n\r\nVery special thanks to @mbaret for authoring test_pass_collage_partition.py.\r\n\r\nLogic to prune the candidates after step 3 will be in a follow up PR since it\r\ndeserves its own testing.

https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md.\r\n\r\nWe complete the PartitionRule sub-class hierarchy with the addition of\r\nCombinePartitionRule, which allows disjoint candidate partitions to be\r\nunioned based on simple rules.\r\n - By TOpPattern kind, eg a kOutElemwiseFusable and kBroadcast.\r\n - A tuple argument with injective fields.\r\n - The projection from an injective group (obviously of tuple type)\r\n - Combinations of the above.\r\nThese let us mimic many common fusion strategies, including TVMs, so that\r\nthe candidates explored during Collage search are as large as possible to\r\nexpose possible fusion opportunities but no larger.\r\n\r\nAlso completes CandidatePartition with the EstimateCost method, which is\r\nused during search to construct a stand-alone IRModule for latency estimation.\r\nThank you @mbaret  for authoring the MockCostEstimator on which those\r\ntests depend.\r\n\r\nFinish units tests for PartitionRule and

change makes the Arduino `read_transport` and `write_transport` methods obey the timeout parameters passed into them. This change is required if we wish to run large models multiple times to get a better average runtime. Also contains a few fixes to improve autotuning:\r\n- Adds an optional `timeout_override` parameter to `create_aot_session`, allowing this function to be used to evaluate large models.\r\n- Changes `tvm.micro.testing.get_target` to use `-device=arm_cpu` by default. \r\n\r\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

PR refactors the key schedule primitive `tensorize`, cleaning up the logic and brings the following benefits:\r\n1) `tensorize` is now failure-safe: previously if a failure happens between `blockize` and structural pattern matching, the sref tree is left unmaintained\r\n2) `tensorize` is now correct if a TIR is tensorized multiple times with the same tensor intrin: previously the intrin is not deep copied, so the pointer equality used in ScheduleState will fail if the TIR is tensorized multiple times\r\n\r\nPer discussion with @vinx13 @yzh119 @spectrometerHBH
