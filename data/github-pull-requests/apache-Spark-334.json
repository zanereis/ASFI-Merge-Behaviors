change introduces a new auth mechanism to the transport library,\r\nto be used when users enable strong encryption. This auth mechanism\r\nhas better security than the currently used DIGEST-MD5.\r\n\r\nThe new protocol uses symmetric key encryption to mutually authenticate\r\nthe endpoints, and is very loosely based on ISO/IEC 9798.\r\n\r\nThe new protocol falls back to SASL when it thinks the remote end is old.\r\nBecause SASL does not support asking the server for multiple auth protocols,\r\nwhich would mean we could re-use the existing SASL code by just adding a\r\nnew SASL provider, the protocol is implemented outside of the SASL API\r\nto avoid the boilerplate of adding a new provider.\r\n\r\nDetails of the auth protocol are discussed in the included README.md\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThis change partly undos the changes added in SPARK-13331; AES encryption\r\nis now decoupled from SASL authentication. The encryption code itself,\r\nthough, has been re-used as part of this change.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Unit tests\r\n- Tested Spark 2.2 against Spark 1.6 shuffle service with SASL enabled\r\n- Tested Spark 2.2 against Spark 2.2 shuffle service with SASL fallback disabled\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-09T22:01:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T01:16:07Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T18:46:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da75ce339efabce52d64c0e55ae898945cf1cf3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39df4b312997e4c2f9bacfb9da2d5adaad8af509","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-19139","ref":"SPARK-19139","sha":"39df4b312997e4c2f9bacfb9da2d5adaad8af509","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInserting data into Hive tables has its own implementation that is distinct from data sources: `InsertIntoHiveTable`, `SparkHiveWriterContainer` and `SparkHiveDynamicPartitionWriterContainer`.\r\n\r\nNote that one other major difference is that data source tables write directly to the final destination without using some staging directory, and then Spark itself adds the partitions/tables to the catalog. Hive tables actually write to some staging directory, and then call Hive metastore's loadPartition/loadTable function to load those data in. So we still need to keep `InsertIntoHiveTable` to put this special logic. In the future, we should think of writing to the hive table location directly, so that we don't need to call `loadTable`/`loadPartition` at the end and remove `InsertIntoHiveTable`.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `SparkHiveWriterContainer` and `SparkHiveDynamicPartitionWriterContainer`, and create a `HiveFileFormat` to implement the write logic. In the future, we should also implement the read logic in `HiveFileFormat`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n```Scala\r\n        sql(\"CREATE TABLE tab (a STRING) STORED AS PARQUET\")\r\n\r\n        // This table fetch is to fill the cache with zero leaf files\r\n        spark.table(\"tab\").show()\r\n\r\n        sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '$newPartitionDir' OVERWRITE\r\n             |INTO TABLE tab\r\n           \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        spark.table(\"tab\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the returned result is empty after table loading. The metadata cache could be out of dated after loading new data into the table, because loading/inserting does not update the cache. So far, the metadata cache is only used for data source tables. Thus, for Hive serde tables, only `parquet` and `orc` formats are facing such issues, because the Hive serde tables in the format of  parquet/orc could be converted to data source tables when `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet`/`spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreOrc` is on. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to refresh the metadata cache after processing the `LOAD DATA` command.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Spark SQL does not convert **partitioned** Hive tables (orc/parquet) to data source tables in the write path, but the read path is using the metadata cache for both **partitioned** and non-partitioned Hive tables (orc/parquet). That means, writing the partitioned parquet/orc tables still use `InsertIntoHiveTable`, instead of `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`. To avoid reading the out-of-dated cache, `InsertIntoHiveTable` needs to refresh the metadata cache for partitioned tables. Note, it does not need to refresh the cache for non-partitioned parquet/orc tables, because it does not call `InsertIntoHiveTable` at all. Based on the comments, this PR will keep the existing logics unchanged. That means, we always refresh the table no matter whether the table is partitioned or not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases in

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17204)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of bugs in the `BlockManager` with respect to support for replicated off-heap storage. First, the locally-stored off-heap byte buffer is disposed of when it is replicated. It should not be. Second, the replica byte buffers are stored as heap byte buffers instead of direct byte buffers even when the storage level memory mode is off-heap. This PR addresses both of these problems.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`BlockManagerReplicationSuite` was enhanced to fill in the coverage gaps. It now fails if either of the bugs in this PR exist.","created_at":"2017-01-07T21:38:12Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T17:24:07Z","closed_at":"2017-03-21T03:54:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be18d3d6e1c0f73f1e7a1fdaf759ce5353b8e256","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45eb0066dc0eb4003e371735855825bcd1c91524","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-17204-replicated_off_heap_storage","ref":"spark-17204-replicated_off_heap_storage","sha":"45eb0066dc0eb4003e371735855825bcd1c91524","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI have a frequency distribution table with following entries\r\nAge,    No of person \r\n21, 10\r\n22, 15\r\n23, 18 \r\n..\r\n..\r\n30, 14\r\nMoreover it is common to have data in frequency distribution format to further calculate Percentile, Median. With current implementation\r\nIt would be very difficult and complex to find the percentile.\r\nTherefore i am proposing enhancement to current Percentile and Approx Percentile implementation to take frequency distribution column into consideration \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1) Enhanced /sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/PercentileSuite.scala to cover the additional functionality \r\n2) Run some performance benchmark test with 20 million row in local environment and did not see any performance degradation\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.","created_at":"2017-01-07T18:45:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T18:21:28Z","closed_at":"2017-02-07T13:07:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e82c7ce6772df08697a2fa23e7c6000535f10e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/58e7a635d2d138fe6809f6bb6898322e1ea956e0","head":{"label":"tanejagagan:branch-18940","ref":"branch-18940","sha":"58e7a635d2d138fe6809f6bb6898322e1ea956e0","user":{"login":"tanejagagan","id":8993562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTM1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8993562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan","html_url":"https://github.com/tanejagagan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77273101,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzI3MzEwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tanejagagan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tanejagagan","id":8993562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTM1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8993562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan","html_url":"https://github.com/tanejagagan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanejagagan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tanejagagan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile adding DistributedLDAModel training summary for SparkR, I found that the logPrior for original and loaded model is different.\r\nFor example, in the test(\"read/write DistributedLDAModel\"), I add the test:\r\nval logPrior = model.asInstanceOf[DistributedLDAModel].logPrior\r\nval logPrior2 = model2.asInstanceOf[DistributedLDAModel].logPrior\r\nassert(logPrior === logPrior2)\r\nThe test fails:\r\n-4.394180878889078 did not equal -4.294290536919573\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `graph.vertices.aggregate(0.0)(seqOp, _ + _)` only returns the value of a single vertex instead of the aggregation of all vertices. Therefore, when the loaded model does the aggregation in a different order, it returns different `logPrior`.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to #16464 for details.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new unit test for testing logPrior.","created_at":"2017-01-06T20:44:58Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T19:32:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-07T19:09:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abdbaca3095d10dc830975fd24b208d43464eb15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a29d07861b1c7ed6355474b8afb9d7ffc590158f","head":{"label":"wangmiao1981:ldabug","ref":"ldabug","sha":"a29d07861b1c7ed6355474b8afb9d7ffc590158f","user":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41932153,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTkzMjE1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"wangmiao1981/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nGraphs with sinks (vertices with no outgoing edges) don't have the expected rank sum of n (or 1 for personalized). We fix this by normalizing to the expected sum at the end of each implementation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this fixes the dynamic version of personal pagerank which gave incorrect answers that were not detected by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRevamped existing and additional unit tests with reference values (and reproduction code) from igraph and NetworkX.\r\n\r\nNote that for comparison on personal pagerank we use the arpack algorithm in igraph as prpack (the  current default) redistributes rank to all vertices uniformly instead of just to the personalization source. We could take the alternate convention (redistribute rank to all vertices uniformly) but that would involve more extensive changes to the algorithms (the dynamic version would no longer be able to use Pregel).\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-06T06:48:16Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T21:25:34Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T21:25:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa41c70a6c8eb4fb90820e7dd15e6f7331d567aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac5d0ce1bdf2cf1e570107613e55c7c24b58a638","head":{"label":"aray:pagerank-sink2","ref":"pagerank-sink2","sha":"ac5d0ce1bdf2cf1e570107613e55c7c24b58a638","user":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35430088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQzMDA4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"aray/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aray/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`OutputWriterFactory`/`OutputWriter` are internal interfaces and we can remove some unnecessary APIs:\r\n1. `OutputWriterFactory.newWriter(path: String)`: no one calls it and no one implements it.\r\n2. `OutputWriter.write(row: Row)`: during execution we only call `writeInternal`, which is weird as `OutputWriter` is already an internal interface. We should rename `writeInternal` to `write` and remove `def write(row: Row)` and it's related converter code. All implementations should just implement `def write(row: InternalRow)`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.","created_at":"2017-01-05T16:01:47Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T20:54:42Z","closed_at":"2017-01-07T16:44:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79180393ca17f5ded983340b9da432f6d0be1e15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/902f17abd1d076ef08347f383f4dd79e9a28e792","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:hive-writer","ref":"hive-writer","sha":"902f17abd1d076ef08347f383f4dd79e9a28e792","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is going to revise the current API for User Defined Types (UDTs).\r\n\r\nCurrently the API of `UserDefinedType` asks developers to implement the method that fills user data into SparkSQL's internal format such as `GenericInternalRow`, `UnsafeArrayData`, etc.\r\n\r\nOne target of this patch is to simplify the way to write UDTs. Developers can just use Scala types, instead of internal types such as ArrayData, when writing UDTs. `UserDefinedType` will use SparkSQL's encoder to convert user data to internal format.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following is the serialization method of `MatrixUDT`.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n\r\n    override def serialize(obj: Matrix): InternalRow = {\r\n      val row = new GenericInternalRow(7)\r\n      obj match {\r\n        case sm: SparseMatrix =>\r\n          row.setByte(0, 0)\r\n          row.setInt(1, sm.numRows)\r\n          row.setInt(2, sm.numCols)\r\n          row.update(3, UnsafeArrayData.fromPrimitiveArray(sm.colPtrs))\r\n          row.update(4, UnsafeArrayData.fromPrimitiveArray(sm.rowIndices))\r\n          row.update(5, UnsafeArrayData.fromPrimitiveArray(sm.values))\r\n          row.setBoolean(6, sm.isTransposed)\r\n\r\n        case dm: DenseMatrix =>\r\n          row.setByte(0, 1)\r\n          row.setInt(1, dm.numRows)\r\n          row.setInt(2, dm.numCols)\r\n          row.setNullAt(3)\r\n          row.setNullAt(4)\r\n          row.update(5, UnsafeArrayData.fromPrimitiveArray(dm.values))\r\n          row.setBoolean(6, dm.isTransposed)\r\n      }\r\n      row\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n\r\n    override def writeRow(obj: Matrix): Row = {\r\n      obj match {\r\n        case sm: SparseMatrix =>\r\n          Row(0.toByte, sm.numRows, sm.numCols, sm.colPtrs, sm.rowIndices, sm.values, sm.isTransposed)\r\n\r\n        case dm: DenseMatrix =>\r\n          Row(1.toByte, dm.numRows, dm.numCols, null, null, dm.values, dm.isTransposed)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDevelopers now manipulate external row `Row` and Scala types. Encoder will take care of converting the data to SparkSQL's internal format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Main API change\r\n\r\nIn the past, two main methods are needed to be implemented in developers' UDTs which extend `UserDefinedType`.\r\n\r\n    /** Convert the user type to a SQL datum */\r\n    def serialize(obj: UserType): Any\r\n\r\n    /** Convert a SQL datum to the user type */\r\n    def deserialize(datum: Any): UserType\r\n\r\nDevelopers put/get the data of user class into/from an internal type of Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nNow developers after this patch, are changed to implement two methods which put/get user data into/from an external row of SparkSQL.\r\n\r\n    /** Convert the object of user type to an external row. Must be implemented in subclasses. */\r\n    def writeRow(obj: UserType): Row\r\n\r\n    /** Convert the external row to an object of user type. Must be implemented in subclasses. */\r\n    def readRow(row: Row): UserType\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\nRan a benchmark against previous `UserDefinedType`.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n    private val random = new Random(100)\r\n    private lazy val pointsRDD = (0 to 1000).map { i =>\r\n      val features = (0 to 100).map { _ =>\r\n        random.nextDouble()\r\n      }\r\n      MyLabeledPoint(i % 10, new UDT.MyDenseVector(features.toArray))\r\n    }.toDF()\r\n\r\n    test(\"serialize MyLabeledPoint\") {\r\n      val N = 10L << 5\r\n      runBenchmark(\"serialize MyLabeledPoint\", N) {\r\n        pointsRDD.groupBy('label).agg(max('features)).collect()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n\r\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_102-b14 on Linux 4.4.39-moby\r\n    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n    serialize MyLabeledPoint:                Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    serialize MyLabeledPoint wholestage off        271 /  328          0.0      845767.7       1.0X\r\n    serialize MyLabeledPoint wholestage on         131 /  261          0.0      408173.6       2.1X\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n\r\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_102-b14 on Linux 4.4.39-moby\r\n    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n    serialize MyLabeledPoint:                Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n

can compete or be slightly better than previous one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Jenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of expression `field` which is implemented as built-in function by Hive and MySQL.\r\n\r\nfield(expr, expr1, expr2, ... ) is a variable-length(>=2) function that returns the index of expr in (expr1, expr2, ...) list or 0 if not found.\r\n\r\n * It takes at least 2 parameters, and all parameters can be of any type.\r\n * Implicit cast will be done when at least 2 parameters have different types, and it will be based on the first parameter's type.\r\n * If the first parameter is of NumericType, all parameters will be implicitly cast to DoubleType, and those that can't be cast to DoubleType will be regarded as NULL.\r\n * If the first parameter is of any other type, all parameters will be implicitly cast to StringType and the comparison will follow String's comparing rules.\r\n * If the search expression is NULL, the return value is 0 because NULL fails equality comparison with any value.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are in ConditionalExpressionSuite & ColumnExpressionSuite.","created_at":"2017-01-05T10:50:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:21Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0829859b307b4492f262f07917469872beaaab62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c75d786aef5632098a78be3640a67463374e9c8b","head":{"label":"gcz2022:udffield","ref":"udffield","sha":"c75d786aef5632098a78be3640a67463374e9c8b","user":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75595311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTU5NTMxMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gcz2022/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have a config `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles` which can be used to ignore corrupt files when reading files in SQL. Currently the `ignoreCorruptFiles` config has two issues and can't work for Parquet:\r\n\r\n1. We only ignore corrupt files in `FileScanRDD` . Actually, we begin to read those files as early as inferring data schema from the files. For corrupt files, we can't read the schema and fail the program. A related issue reported at http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Skip-Corrupted-Parquet-blocks-footer-tc20418.html\r\n2. In `FileScanRDD`, we assume that we only begin to read the files when starting to consume the iterator. However, it is possibly the files are read before that. In this case, `ignoreCorruptFiles` config doesn't work too.\r\n\r\nThis patch targets Parquet datasource. If this direction is ok, we can address the same issue for other datasources like Orc.\r\n\r\nTwo main changes in this patch:\r\n\r\n1. Replace `ParquetFileReader.readAllFootersInParallel` by implementing the logic to read footers in multi-threaded manner\r\n\r\n    We can't ignore corrupt files if we use `ParquetFileReader.readAllFootersInParallel`. So this patch implements the logic to do the similar thing in `readParquetFootersInParallel`.\r\n\r\n2. In `FileScanRDD`, we need to ignore corrupt file too when we call `readFunction` to return iterator.\r\n\r\nOne thing to notice is:\r\n\r\nWe read schema from Parquet file's footer. The method to read footer `ParquetFileReader.readFooter` throws `RuntimeException`, instead of `IOException`, if it can't successfully read the footer. Please check out https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/df9d8e415436292ae33e1ca0b8da256640de9710/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/ParquetFileReader.java#L470. So this patch catches `RuntimeException`.

For the Spark history server API users, it is not possible to determine task status and duration. Spark history server has access to task status and duration from event log, but it is not exposing these in API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCSV type inferencing causes `IllegalArgumentException` on decimal numbers with heterogeneous precisions and scales because the current logic uses the last decimal type in a **partition**. Specifically, `inferRowType`, the **seqOp** of **aggregate**, returns the last decimal type. This PR fixes it to use `findTightestCommonType`.\r\n\r\n**decimal.csv**\r\n```\r\n9.03E+12\r\n1.19E+11\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCSV type inferencing causes `IllegalArgumentException` on decimal numbers with heterogeneous precisions and scales because the current logic uses the last decimal type in a **partition**. Specifically, `inferRowType`, the **seqOp** of **aggregate**, returns the last decimal type. This PR fixes it to use `findTightestCommonType`.\r\n\r\n**decimal.csv**\r\n```\r\n9.03E+12\r\n1.19E+11\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we append data to a partitioned table with `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`, there are 2 issues:\r\n1. doesn't work when the partition has custom location.\r\n2. will recover all partitions\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes them by moving the special partition handling code from `DataSourceAnalysis` to `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`, so that the `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` code path can also benefit from it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnewly added regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn SparkSession initialization, we store created the instance of SparkSession into a class variable _instantiatedContext. Next time we can use SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() to retrieve the existing SparkSession instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the active SparkContext is stopped and we create another new SparkContext to use, the existing SparkSession is still associated with the stopped SparkContext. So the operations with this existing SparkSession will be failed.\r\n\r\nWe need to detect such case in SparkSession and renew the class variable _instantiatedContext if needed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test added in PySpark.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

However, if the partition location is not under the location of the partitioned table, it is not deleted as expected.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor all of the classifiers in MLLib we can predict probabilities except for GBTClassifier.  \r\nAlso, all classifiers inherit from ProbabilisticClassifier but GBTClassifier strangely inherits from Predictor, which is a bug.\r\nThis change corrects the interface and adds the ability for the classifier to give a probabilities vector.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe basic ML tests were run after making the changes.  I've marked this as WIP as I need to add more tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-30T20:31:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T06:01:11Z","closed_at":"2017-01-18T23:36:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84cac2ac5309d0307f533eaac8b58de9529a804e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/818de810cbfdf4fc671f21a262a34cc8554f9af6","head":{"label":"imatiach-msft:ilmat/fix-GBT","ref":"ilmat/fix-GBT","sha":"818de810cbfdf4fc671f21a262a34cc8554f9af6","user":{"login":"imatiach-msft","id":24683184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgzMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24683184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76980395,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njk4MDM5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"imatiach-msft/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imatiach-msft","id":24683184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgzMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24683184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo support `FETCH_FIRST`, SPARK-16563 used Scala `Iterator.duplicate`. However,\r\nScala `Iterator.duplicate` uses a **queue to buffer all items between both iterators**,\r\nthis causes GC and hangs for queries with large number of rows.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn object hash aggregate, we fall back to sort based aggregate using a very conservative strategy: when the size of the hash map exceeds a small threshold, we fall back. This is because we don't know the size of the buffer row and have to be careful to avoid over consuming the memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds size estimation in object hash aggregate, so that we can fall back more aggressively.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, PySpark does not work with Python 3.6.0.\r\n\r\nRunning `./bin/pyspark` simply throws the error as below and PySpark does not work at all:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/shell.py\", line 30, in <module>\r\n    import pyspark\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/__init__.py\",

 File \".../spark/python/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 394, in namedtuple\r\n    cls = _old_namedtuple(*args, **kwargs)\r\nTypeError: namedtuple() missing 3 required keyword-only arguments: 'verbose', 'rename', and 'module'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems because some arguments of `namedtuple` are now completely keyword-only arguments from Python 3.6.0 (See https://bugs.python.org/issue25628).\r\n\r\nWe currently copy this function via `types.FunctionType` which does not set the default values of keyword-only arguments (meaning `namedtuple.__kwdefaults__`) and this seems causing internally missing values in the function (non-bound arguments).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to work around this by manually setting it via `kwargs` as `types.FunctionType` seems not supporting to set this.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR ports the changes in cloudpickle for compatibility for Python 3.6.0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with Python 2.7.6 and Python 3.6.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pyspsark\r\n```\r\n\r\n, manual creation of `namedtuple` both in local and rdd with Python 3.6.0,\r\n\r\nand Jenkins tests for other Python versions.\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\n\r\n```\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python3.6']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-core', 'pyspark-ml', 'pyspark-mllib', 'pyspark-sql', 'pyspark-streaming']\r\nFinished test(python3.6): pyspark.sql.tests (192s)\r\nFinished test(python3.6):
