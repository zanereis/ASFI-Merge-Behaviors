Because `end_date` is derived from `start_date`, and `start_date` being defined as `datetime.now() - parse_time_delta(START_DATE_ENV)` constantly changes, this causes `end_date` to move forward in time as well. While  (from what I understand) the `start_date` is assigned to a DAG only once, the `end_date` is not, so it is constantly updated, which allows scheduler to create more DagRuns than specified by \"PERF_MAX_RUNS\" (it can be easily observed especially with small \"PERF_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL\" values like \"1m\").\r\n\r\nI have added option to provide `start_date` as a date string via \"PERF_START_DATE\" environment variable, which overrides \"PERF_START_AGO\" and is required when \"PERF_MAX_RUNS\" is defined. I also had to change the \"START_DATE\" part of the `dag_id`, which becomes the `start_date` timestamp when \"PERF_START_DATE\" is defined. We cannot use timestamp when using \"PERF_START_AGO\", again due to moving nature of `start_date` (it would cause the constant stream of new DAGs being created).\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

this change we attempt to better diagnose some occasional\r\nnetwork docker-compose issues that have beeen plaguing us after\r\nwe solved or workarounded other CI-related issues. Sometimes\r\nthe docker compose jobs fail on checking if the container is\r\nup and running with either of the two errors:\r\n\r\n * 'forward host lookup failed: Unknown host`\r\n * 'DNS fwd/rev mismatch'\r\n\r\nUsually this happens in rabbitMQ and openldap containers.\r\n\r\nBoth indicate a problem with DNS of the docker engine or maybe\r\nsome remnants of the previous docker run that do not allow us\r\nto start those containers.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces few improvements:\r\n\r\n* added --volume in `docker system prune` command which might\r\n  clean-up some anonymous volumes left by the containers between\r\n  runs\r\n\r\n* removed docker-compose down --remove-orphans --down command\r\n  after failure, as currently we are anyhow always doing it\r\n  few lines before (before the test). This change will cause\r\n  that our mechanism of logging container logs after failure\r\n  will likely give us more information about in case the root\r\n  cause is rabbitmq or openldap container failing to start\r\n\r\n* Increases number of tries to 5 in case of failed containers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

took me quite a while to piece together how exactly operators, hooks, and providers would be released and distributed in Airflow 2.0 and beyond from various mailing list threads, AIPs, and slack conversations. Hoping that adding a little bit of color to readmes in the relevant subdirectories will help users who may be less familiar with the maintenance of the project figure out how exactly the operators, hooks, and providers directories differ. Someone should give these a quick once-over to validate that my mental model is accurate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

feature for postgres_to_gcs operator that allows to use server side cursor. More in the issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8664\r\n\r\nI was thinking about multiple designs to generalize it a bit more, but in the end went with straight forward solution on doing it only for postgres db, while keeping it consistent with presto_to_gcs operator. If there would be more demand for server-side cursors implemented on other dbs as well (mssql, mysql), generalization can be done then.\r\n\r\nbtw, had great experience with Breeze, absolutely love it! I was sceptic and was counting on \"this will help you develop, but it will yield 100 errors anyway\" experience, but it was really a breeze - install, read docs, run.

together,\r\nI experienced an issue when mounting my **dags folder** from an externally populated PVC like described [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/master/chart#mounting-dags-from-an-externally-populated-pvc). Problem was that the **subPath** was still set in the dags mount even though gitSync was disabled - so the dag files were not found. \r\n\r\nIt's loosely related to #11696 , as I was also experiencing this issue also there but that issue is about access to the pod logs from the

if all the libraries `EXTRAS_REQUIREMENTS` section in `setup.py` are documented in the `installation.rst` file.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nChecking if these two files are in sync is tricky cos there is a lot of freedom in how `setup.py` is documented. Entries in `EXTRAS_REQUIREMENTS` can take these forms:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'name': name,\r\n'alias': name\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the documentation, this can be reflected as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| name       | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[alias]'`|\r\n| alias      | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[name]'` |\r\n| name       | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[name]'` |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is not strict:\r\n\r\n1. In the first round, it checks if either packaged name from `setup.py` or any of its aliases is present in the second column in the `installation.rst` file.\r\n2. In the second round, it checks if a name listed in the second column in `installation.rst` is listed as a name or alias in the `setup.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\n\r\nThere are differences between these two files. I fixed them to be able to commit the changes. But these packages documentation should be updated:\r\n\r\n* pagerduty\r\n* plexus\r\n* sentry\r\n* singularity\r\n* tableau\r\n* virtualenv\r\n\r\ncloses:

though it is NOT RECOMMEND to use FTP because of a lack of security, there may be some users that still need it. \r\n\r\nRegarding the operator itself, I have tried to replicate s3_to_sftp using `with NamedTemporaryFile` with no success.\r\n\r\nRegarding the test, I have tried to somehow modify the s3_to_sftp, but it is very different and I am not sure whether it would fit here. I am a little lost about how to approach the test. I know that I should mock S3 and FTP conn, but then, what is my assertion? In a real-life test, I would assure that there is indeed a file in the remote_path with the name I specified, but I have no clue how to do this with mocks and assertions. Could you help me, please? Thank you very much\r\n\r\nPS: this operator was made almost entirely by my coworker Victor.

we send signal `SIGTERM - 15`   several times to airflow webserver, then gunicorn can become [defunct process](https://askubuntu.com/questions/201303/what-is-a-defunct-process-and-why-doesnt-it-get-killed) and Airflow will not be able to handle this situation and wait in an endless loop. Re-sending the signal to Airflow will cause it to re-send the signal  `SIGTERM - 15` to gunicorn (but it will not receive it anyway) and then re-enter the endless loop. As a result, Airflow can only be stopped by signal `SIGKILL - -9`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that it will fix some of the tests we have in quarantine.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
