Everything appears to compile ok and tests pass. I believe you are much further along in the Cloudstack automated testing arena, so I'm not sure if this is something you would be able to test at some point in the future?\n\nIf not I will be able to test it when my current workload permits and report back here with my findings.

I am not sure whether we support Xenserver 6.1.0 and 6.2.0 without XSHotFix62ESP1004. This conditional check is there to make sure users are able to upgrade in transition period. If that's not the case we can remove condition all together and can send command to hypervisor.\n\nTo test this issue we need different versions of XenServer. Versions which we are mentioning in condition in that case it should go to SSVM and in other cases it should go to Hypervsior.

If there are two accounts using the same key, but create a different key name for it, and then a vm is created using one of the keys, the view will list both keypairs as belonging to the vm, which can in turn cause confusion to the users who see a keypair name which they did not create. \n\nThe fix simply limits the view to displaying keypairs which belong to vm's account. \n\nI added it to the

pull request refactors the VirtualMachineName class into an injectable dependency. It is one of the few remaining classes that appears to be spaghetti tangled through many places in the code, and it hasn't been updated in years. These two commits introduce a VirtualMachineNameService which is injected everywhere it's relevant.\n\nThe rationale for this is to separate concerns better and remove spaghetti dependencies on static methods. It also opens up the door to easier extensibility in the future.\n\nSome potential issues with this pull request:\n- Should the VirtualMachineNameService go into spring-core-managers-context.xml?\n- I have added an injection to both VMWare and HypervDirectConnectResource. HyperV already had an inject, but VMWare did not. Both of these are direct agents which means they run in the management server... so injection should work. But I don't know if this violates some guideline or not.\n","created_at":"2015-10-27T15:31:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T09:27:59Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T09:27:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acbbb81515c191a7033a3556d6b02f93c97afb69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bc18cabc9d4c5d3c9fca60f4cc867250e5e075dc","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-vm-name-destatic","ref":"pr-vm-name-destatic","sha":"bc18cabc9d4c5d3c9fca60f4cc867250e5e075dc","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"359d20e8d6d11a992755926a0cf1b1f2a5454487","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

deploying ACS as a WAR file in a vanilla tomcat installation, I always get an error reporting that the JDBC driver for MySQL can't be found. This PR loads said driver before establishing a connection.\n\nI tried to figure out how this is done in the ACS rpm but I couldn't. Therefore I open this PR to enable anyone that wants to deploy ACS as a WAR file.\nThe PR also adds a dependency on mysql connector in the developer profile. Without this dependency the build will fail because the driver manager won't be able to load the driver class.\n\nI have tested this PR by deploying the resulting WAR several times, and I have to say to reviewers, that the war needs to be rename to client.war, otherwise the UI will not work.\n","created_at":"2015-10-19T13:24:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T19:51:40Z","closed_at":"2015-11-03T15:35:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d8ffd59ad46aba606083991e55a94138bbbd899","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ccb2cd9568fd7d2febfe6de08e43c43e460c0bee","head":{"label":"miguelaferreira:load-mysql-driver-before-connecting-to-db","ref":"load-mysql-driver-before-connecting-to-db","sha":"ccb2cd9568fd7d2febfe6de08e43c43e460c0bee","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40481513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDQ4MTUxMw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"miguelaferreira/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

this commit we created tests cases for the respective classes in package  “com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource”.\n\nWe added test cases to check the implementation of  “com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBase.getPatchFiles”. Therefore, we test in a more comprehensive way the tests that already exist to check the code of “com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBase.getPatchFilePath”.\n\nWe added a new abstract class, called com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBaseTest.java\n\nThis class has two tests methods:\n- com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBaseTest.testGetPathFilesExeption(CitrixResourceBase), this method tests if the getPatchFilePath() method throws the com.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException.CloudRuntimeException when the com.cloud.utils.script.Script.findScript(String, String) return a null value;\n- com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBaseTest.testGetPathFilesListReturned(CitrixResourceBase), this method tests the correct return value from getPatchFilePath() method, basically, verify if the returned list contain the file with the same absolute path that was retrieved from the findScript method.\n\nWe also changed the name of those test classes, the change was basically remove the “Path” word from the name of classes.\n","created_at":"2015-10-17T20:40:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T09:13:22Z","closed_at":"2015-12-03T09:13:22Z","merged_at":"2015-12-03T09:13:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"e228b8b8a4ca81513b37c8bb3acace76f426b973","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d01cdb19794f00cef8c97729daf25123335a7f44","head":{"label":"rafaelweingartner:lrg-cs-hackday-012","ref":"lrg-cs-hackday-012","sha":"d01cdb19794f00cef8c97729daf25123335a7f44","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36757203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjc1NzIwMw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"rafaelweingartner/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

The reason for that is explained as follows.\n\nThe adapter configuration is the following:\n<_adapters key=\"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.StorageAllocator\"_>\n      <_adapter name=\"Storage\"\n        class=\"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.impl.FirstFitStorageAllocator\"_>\n        <_param name=\"storage.overprovisioning.factor\"_>2<_/param_>\n      <_/adapter_>\n      <_adapter name=\"\n        class=\"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.impl.RandomStoragePoolAllocator\"_>\n        <_param name=\"storage.overprovisioning.factor\"_>2<_/param_>\n      <_/adapter_>\n<_/adapters_>\n\n• class=\"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.impl.FirstFitStorageAllocator\"\n\nThe class \"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.impl.FirstFitStorageAllocator\" does not exist. The only reference for it is found in the following file:\n          - /cloud-server/test/async-job-component.xml\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is no need for this line at that file.\n\n• class=\"com.cloud.agent.manager.allocator.impl.RandomStoragePoolAllocator\"\n\nAdditionally, the class RandomStoragePoolAllocator.java is never used. The only reference is found in the following file:\n-   /cloud-server/test/async-job-component.xml\n\nI found a project called “cloud-plugin-storage-allocator-random”. This project has only one package that contains only one class, which is the RandomStoragePoolAllocator.java. Despite the names that are the same, the class in “cloud-plugin-storage-allocator-random”  project and the class referenced in -    /cloud-server/test/async-job-component.xml have different packages. Therefore, I removed that configuration from async-job-component.xml and the project that contains only the RandomStoragePoolAllocator class that is never used.\nConsequently, I had to remove the following lines from the _/cloud-client-ui/pom.xml_:\n    <_dependency_>\n      <_groupId_>org.apache.cloudstack<_/groupId_>\n      <_artifactId_>cloud-plugin-storage-allocator-random<_/artifactId_>\n      <_version_>${project.version}<_/version_>\n    <_/dependency_>\n\nFurthermore, after I removed that configuration I noticed that there is no such class StorageAllocator.java. However, it appears that exists test for it, like the following classes: \n-   StorageAllocatorTestConfiguration.java\n-   StorageAllocatorTest.java. \n\nI am not sure if these classes are tests for the class StorageAllocator.java and for the possible configuration I have just removed. If they are, we can remove both classes. Can someone help me on checking that?

current VPN uses are added in the VPN tab inside the public IP after the VPN is enabled. For each network(for which VPN is supported and enabled), the VPN users are shared. As the Cloudstack doc says “ The account owner can create and manage users for their VPN. CloudStack does not use its account database for this purpose but uses a separate table. The VPN user database is shared across all the VPNs created by the account owner. All VPN users get access to all VPNs created by the account owner.”\n\nThe current implementation of going inside each network and adding VPN users give a first feel as if the users are network based.

PR fixes the following issues:\n- KeepAliveD being restarted for each action performed on the routers\n- ConntrackD configuration being copied for each action performed on the routers, causing several restarts\n- ACS Management Server relying in the JSON file to report which router is Master/Backup\n- Public Interface on both routers are in UP state due to several places checking if the interface is UP/DOWN and trying to do KeepAliveD\n- Removing all the sleeps from the test_vpc_redundant.py - those are no longer needed\n- When KeepAliveD calls master.py during the election, update the cmdline.json to set the router in Backup mode: the election will take care of changing it afterwards.\n- Add LB stats_rules to iptables INPUT chain\n- The RVR public interface is set to eth2 instead of eth1 - as in the rVPC. Make sure the check works in both cases\n\nThose fixes make all the routers very stable, with ACL, FW, PF and LB working just fine!\n","created_at":"2015-10-17T15:57:52Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T06:01:26Z","closed_at":"2015-10-20T06:01:25Z","merged_at":"2015-10-20T06:01:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"91a34f62acc31e7d4a843b0c075dd8bf374872b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/fb33cb28aba7bfc829651e8881a9a6afa6a70a76","head":{"label":"artificially-ai:fix/rvr__keepalived_restart","ref":"fix/rvr__keepalived_restart","sha":"fb33cb28aba7bfc829651e8881a9a6afa6a70a76","user":{"login":"artificially-ai","id":4188903,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQxODg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4188903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/artificially-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9363be33972eaccf734fd3caa04dfb981a788dce","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache
