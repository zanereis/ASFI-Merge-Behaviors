cleaner supports dynamic configs for the following:\r\n```\r\nval ReconfigurableConfigs: Set[String] = Set(\r\n    CleanerConfig.LOG_CLEANER_THREADS_PROP,\r\n    CleanerConfig.LOG_CLEANER_DEDUPE_BUFFER_SIZE_PROP,\r\n    CleanerConfig.LOG_CLEANER_DEDUPE_BUFFER_LOAD_FACTOR_PROP,\r\n    CleanerConfig.LOG_CLEANER_IO_BUFFER_SIZE_PROP,\r\n

dynamically they update as expected, however if the broker is restarted they are not applied. Note that the dynamic config logs correctly, it is just not applied as verified by logs/thread dump.\r\n\r\n**What this PR does:**\r\nThis PR changes the evaluation of these configs in KafkaConfig from `val` to `def` so that they are picked up following dynamic config initialization at KafkaServer startup().\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n- This issue is reproducible manually by updating a log cleaner config such as number of threads and then restarting the broker and checking the number of threads started in the logs. \r\n- This issue is reproducible in the system tests (added) by restarting the server and verifying the number of threads following a restart.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-19T09:02:48Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T14:52:59Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T14:52:58Z","merged_at":"2024-09-19T14:52:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"14c45bed5a1046b65179935188e6205dcfdf6f98","assignee":{"login":"clolov","id":20223851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20223851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov","html_url":"https://github.com/clolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"clolov","id":20223851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20223851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov","html_url":"https://github.com/clolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

About\r\nAn encore of #17184, this addresses the race described https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16949#discussion_r1750273695 and adds a JMH benchmark comparing `HdrHistogram` with Yammer's histogram. It also addresses some nits from that previous PR and rebases on top of the #17011 changes.\r\n\r\nA sample result from a local run on my development machine:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

also includes a fairly reliable test for the race that's being fixed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

the module name\r\n    (clients) differs from the artifact name (kafka-clients).\r\n\r\n    The fix is basically to explicitly define artifact of shadowJar to signing and publish plugin.\r\n    project.shadow.component(mavenJava) previously outputs the name as client-<version>-all.jar\r\n    though the classifier and archivesBaseName are already defined correctly in :clients and\r\n

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17554\r\nIn the previous workflow, the test passes under two conditions:\r\n1. The `t1` thread is waiting for the main thread's client.wakeup(). If successful, `t1` will wake up `t2`, allowing `t2` to complete the future.\r\n2. If `t1` fails to receive the client.wakeup() from the main thread, `t2` will be woken up by the main thread.\r\nThe flaky test error occurs because neither `t1` nor `t2 `are being properly woken up by the main thread. To resolve this, I suggest adjusting the test flow so that the main thread calls client.wakeup() before the t1 thread starts polling. Then, after `t1` starts polling, the `t2` thread can begin its poll. Additionally, I propose increasing the wait time in `MockClient#maybeAwaitWakeup` from 5 seconds to 10 seconds for better reliability.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

I have removed the `transform` methods from the main and test classes.

regarding [KAFKA-17515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17515). \r\nFound two issues in the flaky tests: (Put the log analysis under Jira comments.)\r\n\r\n1. The error \"java.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException\" occurs if the flush() of kafkaStreams.close() and purgeLocalStreamsState() are triggered in the same time. (The current timeout is 5 sec, which is too short since the CI is unstable and slow). \r\n2. Racing issue: Task to-be restored in `ks-1` are rebalanced to `ks-2` before entering active restoring state. So no onRestoreSuspend() was triggered. \r\n\r\nTo solve the issues:\r\n1. Remove the timeout  in kafkaStreams.close() \r\n2. Ensure all tasks in `ks-1` are active restoring before start second KafkaStreams(`ks-2`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-13T08:45:13Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T06:58:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T06:58:04Z","merged_at":"2024-09-19T06:58:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f5cf9968f3005a4ed1acf27fe57456691aac5eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ecdc67545be3a5a352a96931257c087d2a804992","head":{"label":"chenyulin0719:KAFKA-17515","ref":"KAFKA-17515","sha":"ecdc67545be3a5a352a96931257c087d2a804992","user":{"login":"chenyulin0719","id":26764036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzY0MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26764036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyulin0719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":845348510,"node_id":"R_kgDOMmL-ng","name":"kafka","full_name":"chenyulin0719/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenyulin0719","id":26764036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzY0MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26764036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyulin0719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyulin0719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenyulin0719/kafka","description":"Mirror

Each entry should be in the form `{id}@{host}:{port}`.\r\n```\r\nThe cause is that in `kafka.py` line 876, we create a delimited string from a list comprehension, but the input is a string itself, so each character gets appended vs. the bootstrap server string of `host:port`.

About\r\nIn reference to comment https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16969#discussion_r1750770738 , I have introduced a `DelayedActionQueue` to add purgatory actions and try to complete them. \r\n1. I've added code to add purgatory actions to `DelayedActionQueue` when partition locks are released after fetch in `forceComplete`. Also, code has been added to `onExpiration` to check the delayed actions queue and try to complete it. Since `onExpiration` serves as a callback for `forceComplete`, it should not lead to infinite call stack.\r\n2. Also, fixed a few warning in some tests in `DelayedShareFetchTest`which were occurring due to insufficient mocking. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe code has been tested with the help of unit tests.","created_at":"2024-09-12T12:42:06Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T16:32:24Z","closed_at":"2024-10-04T16:32:24Z","merged_at":"2024-10-04T16:32:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"455c79c339a5135e393864fd0e3ce19be35f465e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"apoorvmittal10","id":2861565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjE1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2861565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10","html_url":"https://github.com/apoorvmittal10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

ignored.","created_at":"2024-09-10T01:38:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T14:41:56Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T14:41:49Z","merged_at":"2024-09-11T14:41:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e30209f01728d176906df23fad3cf8b36abbf38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/87c4234f334251b0d587d2a94e2a29a19dd68faa","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-17506-KRaftMigrationDriver-init-race","ref":"KAFKA-17506-KRaftMigrationDriver-init-race","sha":"87c4234f334251b0d587d2a94e2a29a19dd68faa","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

addressing followup comments for KAFKA-16963 (i.e. Jose' comments in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17081), we identified two bugs, KAFKA-17608 and KAFKA-17604, which are fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n### KAFKA-17608\r\nWhen a control batch is committed, the quorum controller currently increases the last stable offset but fails to create a snapshot for that offset. This causes an issue if the quorum controller renounces and needs to revert to that offset (which has no snapshot present)\r\n```\r\n[2024-09-24 20:52:31,970] INFO [RaftManager id=1] Latest set of voters is VoterSet(voters={2=VoterNode(voterKey=ReplicaKey(id=2, directoryId=Optional[yUZ-0ZdF7OAjukDOPmXssA]), listeners=Endpoints(endpoints={ListenerName(CONTROLLER_PLAINTEXT)=ducker03:9592}), supportedKRaftVersion=SupportedVersionRange[min_version:0, max_version:1])}) at offset 101 (org.apache.kafka.raft.internals.KRaftControlRecordStateMachine)\r\n\r\n# NO in-memory snapshot for 101 created\r\n\r\n[2024-09-24 20:52:32,120] INFO [QuorumController id=1] writeNoOpRecord: event failed with NotLeaderException (treated as NotControllerException) at epoch 1 in 367 microseconds. Renouncing leadership and reverting to the last committed offset 101. Exception message: Append failed because the replica is not the current leader (org.apache.kafka.controller.QuorumController)\r\n[2024-09-24 20:52:32,120] ERROR Encountered fatal fault: exception while renouncing leadership (org.apache.kafka.server.fault.ProcessTerminatingFaultHandler)\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to reset to last stable offset 101. No in-memory snapshot found for this offset.\r\n```\r\nSince the control batches are no-ops for the quorum controller, it does not need to update its offsets for control records. We skip handle commit logic for control batches.\r\n\r\n### KAFKA-17604\r\nDescribe quorum output will miss endpoints of voters which were added via AddRaftVoter. This is due to a bug in LeaderState's updateVoterAndObserverStates which will pull replica state from observer states map (which does not include endpoints). The fix is to populate endpoints from the lastVoterSet passed into the method.\r\n\r\n### KAFKA-16963 followups\r\n- Observers output after removing controller _should_ include the controller that was just removed. This was not happening before due to KAFKA-17608.\r\n- advertised.listeners should include the controller listeners\r\n- wait_until used for describe quorum checks to reduce chances of test flakiness\r\n- additional comments and fixing string formatting\r\n- adding type hints which I think will help with future revisions\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-10T01:30:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T21:57:48Z","closed_at":"2024-09-26T17:56:19Z","merged_at":"2024-09-26T17:56:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"68b97705062826f0cef935f4769b1af17f460919","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test
