the Admin interface, the listConsumerGroupOffsets by groupSpecs was chosen\r\nbecause it is the most similar method to the one by groupId. Both methods do\r\nnot need to specify options, but create them with the\r\nListConsumerGroupOffsetsOptions empty constructor and both end up calling\r\nlistConsumerGroupOffsets with a created groupSpecs map and default options.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the method listConsumerGroupOffsets of class\r\nMirrorCheckpointConnector needed to be changed to adjust itself to the new\r\nmethod used.\r\n\r\nSince all group offsets are now obtained asynchronously, it is necessary to \r\nmodify the for loop in findConsumerGroups: the ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult\r\nmust be obtained outside of the for loop, and for each group it is needed to get\r\nits topic partition and metadata.\r\n\r\nTo adjust the tests and perform the mock for listConsumerGroupOffsets, it has\r\nneeded to create futures to create a ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult as the\r\nreturn of listConsumerGroupOffsets. For this reason, the empty constructor has\r\nbecome public to be accessed inside the test class.\r\n\r\nThe assertEquals argument order has been fixed as respectively expected and\r\nactual.\r\n\r\nThe offsetsForGroup4 instance has been removed as listConsumerGroupOffsets could\r\nnot return it as part of the result. This is because group \"g4\" would be\r\nfiltered and not be in the filteredGroup that is passed to\r\nlistConsumerGroupOffsets.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

the `FetchRequestManager` to only create and enqueue fetch requests when signaled to do so by a `FetchEvent`.\r\n\r\nThe application thread and the background thread each contains logic that is performed if there is buffered data from a previous fetch. There's a race condition because the presence of buffered data could change between the two threads’ respective checks. Right now the window for the race condition to occur is _wide open_; this change aims to make the window _ajar_.\r\n\r\nIn the `ClassicKafkaConsumer`, the application thread will explicitly issue fetch requests (via the `Fetcher` class) at specific points in the `Consumer.poll()` cycle. Prior to this change, the `AsyncKafkaConsumer` would issue fetch requests independently from the user calling `Consumer.poll()`; the fetches would happen nearly continuously as soon as _any_ assigned partition was fetchable. With this change, the `AsyncKafkaConsumer` introduces a `FetchEvent` that signals to the background thread that a fetch request should be issued. The specific points where this is done in the `Consumer.poll()` cycle of the `AsyncKafkaConsumer` now match the `ClassicKafkaConsumer`. In short: this makes `AsyncKafkaConsumer` act nearly identical to the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` in this regard.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this change does not completely solve the problem related to fetch session eviction. Exactly how the window where the race condition can be shut completely is outside the scope of this change.\r\n\r\nSee KAFKA-17182.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16673#discussion_r1717009724\r\n\r\nThe `AsyncKafkaConsumer#unsubscribe` uses `Long.MAX_VALUE` to calculate deadline. However, most of `AsyncKafkaConsumer` operations use [default.api.timeout.ms](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_default.api.timeout.ms) if users don't specify a timeout. In [design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Java+client+Consumer+timeouts#JavaclientConsumertimeouts-DefaultTimeouts), it also mentions that using `default.api.timeout.ms` as default timeout.\r\n\r\nThe `AsyncKafkaConsumer#unsubscribe` uses `processBackgroundEvents` to wait for callbacks and a response to the leave group request, so this PR ensures that the api call is bounded by the `default.api.timeout.ms`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

They do happen to work sometimes, but only in the trivial case where we don't create topics or make changes during the upgrade (which would reveal the ZK incompatibility). Instead, we should test only supported scenarios.","created_at":"2024-08-27T23:54:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T19:52:13Z","closed_at":"2024-08-29T19:51:42Z","merged_at":"2024-08-29T19:51:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"453cf9c98763a9cf83b0550bd74417ee5eb59c4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3f65822d1c4fdc1f32f2e843004d4eca3513ce04","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-17434","ref":"KAFKA-17434","sha":"3f65822d1c4fdc1f32f2e843004d4eca3513ce04","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

currently use a `CountDownLatch` to signal when a thread has\ncompleted shutdown to the blocking `shutdown` method. However, this\nlatch triggers _before_ the thread has fully exited.\n\nDependent on the OS thread scheduling, it's possible that this thread\nwill still be \"alive\" after the latch has unblocked the `shutdown`\nmethod.\n\nIn practice, this is mostly a problem for `StreamThreadTest`, which now\nchecks that there are no `TaskExecutor` or `StateUpdater` threads\nimmediately after shutting them down.\n\nSometimes, after shutdown returns, we find that these threads are still\n\"alive\", usually completing execution of the \"thread shutdown\" log\nmessage, or even the `Thread#exit` JVM method that's invoked to clean up\nthreads just before they exit. This causes sporadic test failures, even\nthough these threads did indeed shutdown correctly.\n\nInstead of using a `CountDownLatch`, let's just await the thread to exit\ndirectly, using `Thread#join`. Just as before, we set a timeout, and if\nthe Thread is still alive after the timeout, we throw a\n`StreamsException`, maintaining the contract of the `shutdown` method.\n\nThere should be no measurable impact on production code here. This will\nmostly just improve the reliability of tests that require these threads\nhave fully exited after calling `shutdown`.\n","created_at":"2024-08-27T17:29:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T14:08:13Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T14:05:11Z","merged_at":"2024-08-28T14:05:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9615ed275c3856b73e5b6083049a8def9f59697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ef23bc74873199da528a6090b27277290510149c","head":{"label":"nicktelford:KAFKA-17432","ref":"KAFKA-17432","sha":"ef23bc74873199da528a6090b27277290510149c","user":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439367730,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjA4Mg","name":"kafka","full_name":"nicktelford/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch re-introduces the `group.version` feature flag and gates the new consumer rebalance protocol with it. The `group.version` feature flag is attached to the metadata version `4.0-IV0` and it is marked as production ready. This allows system tests to pick it up directly by default without requiring to set `unstable.feature.versions.enable` in all of them. This is fine because we don't plan to do any incompatible changes before 4.0.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17424\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Kafka connect gives sink task it's own copy of List<SinkRecords> that RAM utilisation shoots up and at that particular moment the there will be two lists and the original list gets cleared after the sink worker finishes the current batch.\r\n\r\nOriginally the list is declared final and it's copy is provided to sink task as those can be custom and we let user process it however they want without any risk. But one of the most popular uses of kafka connect is OLTP - OLAP replication, and during initial copying/snapshots a lot of data is generated rapidly which fills the list to it's max batch size length, and we are prone to \"Out of Memory\" exceptions. And the only use of the list is to get filled > cloned for sink > get size  > cleared > repeat. So I have taken the size of list before giving the original list to sink task and after sink has performed it's operations , set list = new ArrayList<>(). I did not use clear for just in case sink task has set our list to null.\r\n\r\nThere is a time vs memory trade-off, \r\nIn the original approach the jvm does not have spend time to find free memory \r\n\r\nIn new approach the jvm will have to create new list by finding free memory addresses but this results in more free memory.","created_at":"2024-08-26T12:16:44Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T09:21:38Z","closed_at":"2024-08-30T09:21:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cbb6297405b26bef1430d30ac8e8bd4c84419a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17002/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17002/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17002/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e89df2e50da73bff75a43301be0e4b56d31aff69","head":{"label":"ajit97singh:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"e89df2e50da73bff75a43301be0e4b56d31aff69","user":{"login":"ajit97singh","id":99013051,"node_id":"U_kgDOBebRuw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99013051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh","html_url":"https://github.com/ajit97singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":847707963,"node_id":"R_kgDOMob_Ow","name":"kafka","full_name":"ajit97singh/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajit97singh","id":99013051,"node_id":"U_kgDOBebRuw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99013051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh","html_url":"https://github.com/ajit97singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajit97singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajit97singh/kafka","description":"Mirror

ReconfigurableQuorumIntegrationTest to test creating a cluster with KIP-853 enabled, to verify\r\nthat the feature flag is set. Also test removing a voter.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this test work, I needed to allocate ports prior to formatting the storage\r\ndirectories, so that --initial-controllers could be set appropriately. Therefore, I added a new\r\ninterface to SocketServer, the ServerSocketFactory. In a production situation, this opens a port\r\nand binds it. In a unit test, for the CONTROLLER listener, we use the PreboundSocketFactory\r\nimplementation, which returns a pre-allocated port.  This allows the test framework to open the\r\nCONTROLLER ports (and know their values) prior to setting up node configurations and formatting the\r\nstorage directories.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves TestKit over to using the new PreboundSocketFactoryManager mechanism, but leaves\r\nQuorumTestHarness still using the old futures-based mechanism. This was done in order to avoid\r\nmaking the PR bigger. In a follow-on PR, we should convert QuorumTestHarness to the new mechanism\r\nand remove the futures-based mechanism.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR adds some methods to BootstrapMetadata to make it more convenient to create\r\nnew BootstrapMetadata objects. The idea is to avoid the need to mess with FeatureRecords directly,\r\nand make it easy to set whatever features are desired when using TestKit to create a cluster.","created_at":"2024-08-23T22:56:57Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T20:25:57Z","closed_at":"2024-11-05T20:25:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Calls pollOnClose to gather the final requests and send them along with the unsent)\r\n\r\nIf 3 happens in the app thread before 2.1 happens in the background, the HB manager won't have a chance to generate the request to leave. This PR implements the pollOnClose to generate the final request if needed.","created_at":"2024-08-22T22:54:55Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T01:04:25Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T01:04:25Z","merged_at":"2024-08-28T01:04:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9e30289d96b6c096c2bad44d714200e4c34cc04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

About\r\nIntroduced a share fetch purgatory on the broker which delays share fetch requests that cannot be completed instantaneously. Introduced 2 new classes - \r\n1. **DelayedShareFetch** - Contains logic to instantaneously complete or force complete a share fetch request on timeout.\r\n2. **DelayedShareFetchKey** - Contains the key which can be used to watch the entries within the share fetch purgatory.\r\n3. **ShareFetchUtils** - This utility class contains functionalities required for post-processing once the replica manager fetch is completed.\r\n\r\nThere are many scenarios which can cause a share fetch request to be delayed and multiple scenarios when a delayed share fetch can be attempted to be completed. **In

when the `DescribeCluster` API with `EntityType=1` or the `TopicMetadata` API is called, the controller ID value in the response is set to a random broker ID. I'm not sure but I think this approach was used because, before KIP-919, clients couldn't communicate directly with the controller and had to route through a broker. Therefore, the specific broker used to reach the controller didn't matter. However, after KIP-919, it would be more appropriate to return the actual controller ID if the node also serves as a broker. Otherwise, return -1 to avoid confusing users.\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\n**AS-IS:**\r\n- `DescribeCluster` with `EntityType=1` or `TopicMetadata` request -> controller ID is set to a random broker ID.\r\n\r\n**TO-BE:**\r\n- `DescribeCluster` with `EntityType=1` or `TopicMetadata` request -> controller ID is set to the actual controller ID if it also serves as a broker; otherwise, return

HdrHistogram wrapper implementation (HdrHistogram, KafkaMetricHistogram) was authored by @dimitarndimitrov  \r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a wrapper around [HdrHistogram](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram) to use for group coordinator histograms, event queue time, event processing time, flush time, and purgatory time.\r\n\r\nNote that the wrapper refreshes histogram snapshots on a query/read basis - it does not refresh the snapshot if metrics(max, p99, etc) are never queried. The implication is that if we collect metrics at, say every 60s, then the first query will contain 60s worth of data whereas the subsequent queries will generate a new snapshot\r\n\r\n### Committer
